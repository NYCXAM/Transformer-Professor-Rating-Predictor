review,rating
DO NOT take this class with Maksym Moraswki. His lectures is interesting but has nothing to do with our project/exam. His project description does not match how he grade it.,0
"Love how the rate my prof ratings are so much better. https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=1822434. 
Exam wasn't that bad as long as you listen to what he says in class. He doesn't always teach everything in lectures, a lot of self learning is expected of you as well; however, he always points out the topics you have to self learn. It is very clear and probably like an hour of learning outside of class a week.",4
Avoid him. He rewrote the whole class and made all contents unrelated to the projects and exams. His lectures are not useful at all.,0
"He doesn't know how to teach. He deleted all lecture slides from the previous semester which are rather clear and useful, and teach classes without slides. He also canceled a bunch of classes without trying to make up.",0
"Classroom lectures, while interesting, aren't relevant at all to what's actually on the exam, and concepts that are briefly glossed over in class show up as a full-fledged exam question. Nothing in class is really relevant to the knowledge needed to complete the projects past the first couple of lectures.",0
"Cool guy, awful professor. He's always extremely unorganized and unprepared so he just rambles during lecture about things that aren't related to the projects. Additionally, he regularly entertains useless questions that have nothing to do with the class, leading him to go on all sorts of tangents and impromptu comedy bits. He still doesn't understand how to use ELMS, Gradescope, or his class webpage, so from a student's perspective, that makes it really difficult to remember when and where to submit an assignment or take a quiz. Don't take his classes.",0
I learned nothing from his class.,0
"Horrible professor contingent on making your life as confusing and miserable as possible. First exam was a complete crapshoot, so bad in fact that there was not even a GradeScope timer. Genuinely ignore the 5 star review. I ended up with above a 100% on the exam after this curve to compensate how horrible the exam was (removed 10 points from a 42 exam) and I'm telling you he's horrible. Quite horrible.",0
"Great guy, very funny, clearly has experience with what he is teaching. While the first midterm we had did have some more vague questions, it was graded very fair with a curve and numerous questions converted to extra credit. Lectures don't always line-up exactly with projects/exams but are interesting in useful in overall terms for data science. Would guarantee most of the reviews on here that are negative are people who aren't putting in effort/starting projects last minute, etc. Would highly recommend for anyone interested in data science and would advise to take most of these negative reviews with a grain of salt/open mind",4
"Max is a really nice guy and on the first day of class got me excited about the course by telling some very interesting stories about his time in the industry. This was the first time in a CS class that I had been excited to learn or thought to myself, “wow that sounds like something I want to do when I graduate.”

That is why I’m extra disappointed by this class. I suspect that all the Max does to prepare for each day is make a general list of things he wants to talk about and the occasional very plain PowerPoint which he doesn’t stick to. What happens in class is that he simply rambles about said topics without any semblance of structure. There are no key points even if he is using a visual aid. Max will often hand write notes but this is pretty spotty and no one would be able to understand the full picture if they were to try to go back and look at the notes. It is often as if his lectures are simply a conversation between him and people sitting in the front row which quickly breaks down the flow of class and creates too many tangents. It also reveals how unprepared he is when people ask questions and he realizes he should have planned to address that but that it had slipped his mind. This is only a small summary of the issues in this class. Projects are way too hard in comparison for how casually he teaches and test questions seem to be first drafts without any revision. Unless you have the time or personality that would allow you to live in his office hours, don’t expect to get much from Max because his lectures are very difficult to learn from.",0
"easy class, only con is you have to take it with Max. Fun if you want to hear a tech bro boast about his salary every lecture",0
"This review is after Maks addressed what has happened in the class and the midterm recently, which is why you are going to wonder why all the 1 star reviews.
I do agree that he isn't the greatest lecturer, and that a lot of topics that he very lightly brushed on the exam came in full force in the midterm, however I am posting this after he gave an EXTREMELY generous curve and on top of that he admitted that a lot of the questions that seemed out of scope of the class or  that were badly written, well that was actually the case, and he made it up within the curve that he gave us.

It's his first time teaching this course, not sure if actually it's his first time lecturing huge sections, and actually. I was frustrated too with his lectures but I can see why he wants us to learn all of this and he is trying to re-make the class. It's to get us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys who just do python,sql, and stuff to whatever we are told to do for the projects. He is a caring and great guy and I have never seen instructors be so caring to the point of admitting their own mistakes and taking student input in order to improve.

There could be more in depth examples and case scenarios for the next exams theory/stat/math wise, and perhaps include a bit of the project stuff in class, but he is great and trying his best at getting us to get the most out of this course.",4
"The way that CMSC320 is being taught in the fall 2022 is a disaster. 
The class was known as a easy CMSC elective class. But it is not this semester. Morawski is a cool, fun guy. Maybe caring according to my friends, but he is far away from good professor this semester. 
He has a few little lecture slides at the beginning of the semester, but no more after he decided to remake the class. We get speaker notes sometimes, but it is only converging the topics he went over. Furthermore, the lectures he gave doesn't teach us how to do our projects and exams well. We basically need to learn how to do the project on our own - it is much workload that I was expecting for CMSC320. It is probably the workload similar to CMSC216. BTW I start projects early so I can ask TA for help, but they are still time consuming and suffering because you have to find out what are expecting (the project description doesn't always tell you where you graded on) and teach yourselves (since you didn't really learn how to do the project yourself)
Also, I do agree that he is trying to make ""us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys"". But we need to think data-wise AND how to code.  
Many of the exams questions went far away from the scope of the class. And some are bad written. The projects we did (and cmsc320 is project heavy class) probably worth 6 points in the 42 points exam (which is 32 after he gave curve). Also there is no timer on the gradescope when we took the exam so we will realize ""we had to time ourselves!"" after you read the exam starts 3-5 mins. 
He might improve next semester (Spring 2023) based on the feedback he got this semester, but honestly, if you have choice, try to wait a semester to see how it went . At this point, I will say he is definitely 1/5 at CMSC320. If you have to, I will suggest to treat this class not as elective CMSC class that is kinda easy as the previous reviews have, treat it as a CMSC216 class that will took your lots efforts to get A.",0
"I really enjoy his class. He makes the material fun and engaging, and added a lot of real world applications to our lessons.

This is his first semester teaching it, and so it's a bit bumpy because of the transition to new material, but he's been doing his best to make it smooth and respond to student feedback",4
Really gracious curve and very responsive to feedback. Really interesting class.,4
"The main issue is poor organization in lecture. Does not provide clear explanations of each topic nor specific examples. Hand written notes are his passing thoughts rather than coherent, structured notes. I often leave class feeling as if I learned nothing. I struggle to take notes because of lack of structure in lectures. Exam was not very relevant to what was covered in lecture, but he is working on this for the next one! Lectures are not really related to the projects.

Despite all this, Max is a funny and really cool dude. I enjoy talking to him and hearing his thoughts and stories. It's obvious he's working to improve. I appreciate he has industry experience, which he ties to what we're learning!

My recommendations for improvement: 
- Organize lectures with clear explanations of each data science technique, use cases, and relevant examples. 
- Create more organized hand written notes that can serve as a reference. 
- Review key concepts necessary for projects and exams.
- Keep sharing cool stories and industry insights!",1
"Everyone who gave him a 5 star review doesn't understand that just by curving an exam by 30% makes you a better professor. His lectures are still uninteresting, he goes on niche tangents with 3 kids in the class that make lecture an unbearable nightmare where you don't learn anything. I'm willing to bet that the 3 people who gave him those 5 star reviews are the same people who sit front of the class asking him questions to get him to go on random tangents for 90 minutes.",0
Really nice guy passionate about data science. Not a good teacher. If you want to self-teach yourself all of the content in this course then take Maks. His lectures are hard to follow as they involve at least 3 tangents minimum. He is not organized and it is very unclear on how much we need to know about mentioned topics. This makes studying almost impossible. I only did well on the first exam due to prior knowledge and google. I would recommend taking this class with someone else and make your life easier.,0
"Take it with someone else if you actually want to learn something. He's a nice guy, but doesn't really teach anything substantial that's useful for the projects and exams. He talks about various topics at a very surface level but doesn't go into any of the details. The first exam was just STAT 400 questions and student-made questions from Piazza. Also the things we were tested on he didn't really go into much detail in in lecture. Only thing that I have found valuable from this class so far are the projects created by previous professors for the course.",0
"Professor Max is a super down to earth dude. I personally really enjoy his class and he makes lectures fun. 

The way he is teaching CMSC320 is unusual but it comes from a person who has worked in the field, which holds a lot of value in my eyes. 

Projects: not easy but he is reusing projects from other semesters so I don’t understand why people are complaining. A lot of project work is fully self taught, which isn’t unusual for CS courses. The project grading is lenient and Max is super easy to talk to if you have any issues. If you don’t want to self learn then you are going to have a lot of trouble in various CS courses, it’s just how it is unfortunately 

Exam 1: This exam was online so we had access to Google and any notes we had taken. The average was around 65% but Max is giving us a generous curve and again, none of this is unusual for a CMSC course, it’s only really bad if the professor isn’t fair with curving based on the averages, which is not the case here. There were technical difficulties but Max accommodated for that and helped anyone that had issues. Also, the vast majority of the grade comes from projects so this isn’t even a big deal

Lectures: Max talks about the fundamental topics briefly and doesn’t go into too much detail. Again, most of the code you will learn is self taught and contained in the projects, lecture is for high level explanations of the different topics of the course. Max also shares stories about projects he had to do in industry and problem solving techniques he used to get his solutions. All very practical and useful information. if you’re a geek that doesn’t care about real life and want to stuff your face in a text book and fully learn everything in depth, this gem of a lecturer isn’t for you. 

Overall thoughts: I personally think this class is a breath of fresh air amongst the sea of boring and difficult computer science courses. Max actually makes me want to come to lecture as opposed to feeling like I have to. I love having professors that are easy to talk to and feel more down to earth. This is definitely one of the rare instances of a professor that understands that students have a life outside of their course and is willing to accommodate for real excuses. 

Other ratings: I honestly feel like Max is getting a lot of unfair reviews. This is his first semester teaching the course and he is demonstrating a clear willingness to learn and improve as a professor. There are lots of complaints about the unorganized lecture styles, which is a fair criticism that I’m sure he will address in the future, but also bs criticism about an exam that isn’t worth very much of our grade and projects that he didn’t even write? These are literally reused projects from other semesters so if that’s the complaint then you have a problem with the class, not Max. There seems to be two sides to this. If you want to hear real life experiences and get advice about how to make it in the industry, then you’ll like Max. If you’re looking for a professor that solely focuses on teaching the class material, then Max is not for you.

Conclusion: He a little confused but he got the spirit",4
"Great professor that is a little unorganized but makes up for it with real life industry work experience. Max shares his work stories about projects he did and how he did them, which is a lot more valuable to me then just coursework

Max is a breath of fresh air in the sea of super boring work heavy CMSC courses, love the dude

This is his first semester teaching the course and he is very gracious with curves and listens to student concerns. Super down to earth dude. Some technical difficulties in the class but he’s working on them 

Overall: he a little confused be he got the spirit",4
"Has a super fun personality. Unfortunately, this personality also involves him being incredibly hand-wavy for just about every topic, making it impossible to do the projects or the exams without literally learning all of the details and processes (which are deemed uncool) yourself. This is made more difficult by the fact that he's thrown out all of the previous relatively well-structured course material, replacing it with his free-form, tangent-filled lectures, with no useful slides or notes posted. 

Logistics is a nightmare. Completely unreliable and disorganized. Difficult to get in touch with and has yet to timely follow through (if at all) on a single assurance he's made all semester when you do. Hasn't bothered to figure out the most basic software used for the course, making things even worse for students in every way (exams, projects, recordings, notes, slides).

Even if we end up with an insane curve to make up for his incompetence (which seems to be the case from the first exam), we've been taught little in a potentially fascinating course and have been enormously stressed and frustrated.",0
"Horrible teacher. He fails at not only teaching but also responding to relevant questions. His lectures are more about his personal life than it is about data science, and I feel like I wasted a lot of time by even attending the lectures. The fact that he had to curve an exam by >30% in a class that's not even meant to be difficult speaks volumes. As much as I'd like to say he's a good person but bad professor, I'm afraid to say an irresponsible professor is not exactly the best person.

If you're reading this, kindly teach relevant information. As much as some members of the class enjoy your tangents, I (and many others) came here to learn and nothing else. Please teach in a practical and planned manner. I loathe those who are fortunate enough to not value over 90 minutes of time.

To reiterate, if you are reading this: Students come here to learn data science. You are obviously a talented and tested individual, and clearly possess the capability of teaching. I can only assume you think we don't take this course seriously, and therefore neither should you.",0
"Absolutely horrid professor and class. If you take this class get prepared to teach yourself all the material related to any assignment or quiz. He has no comprehension of what it's like to be a student in his class where he handwaves every topic briefly with no reinforcement and then assigns us projects where it is NOT RELATED AT ALL to what he is teaching. He is more concerned with his job at EBay than he is with actually being a good professor and to compensate for this just showers the class in extra credit (which does not make him a better professor). Overall, horrible professor. If you enjoy learning any actual material don't take a class with him. You will regret it.",0
"READ! This semester was his first time teaching and he caused a blunder with the midterm, which wasn't even that bad in my opinion. That's the only reason a bunch of nutcases spammed him with 1-star reviews. Anyway, he curved very reasonably and is set on not repeating his mistake. Aside from this, he consistently enlightens us about the Data Science industry and teaches us useful concepts relevant to the industry. His lectures are fun to go to! Additionally, he listens. He's always asking for feedback and genuinely feels bad for the mistakes he has caused. You study for exams (both online) by following a well-written study guide he provides. Regarding projects, they are also fun and you learn applicable Data Science skills. There's no final exam, but instead, a final project where you can make what you want to while fulfilling certain requirements. Max is super lenient with your ideas and is super easy to talk to. If you're uneasy because of his reviews, just go talk to him and decide for yourself.",4
"Honestly, ignore the 1-star reviews. He has a 5 star on ratemyprofessor out of 30 ratings. It's from UMBC and it's the same Max, I checked his LinkedIn. I can guarantee the 1-star reviewers are all nerds.

Max is hilarious, makes lectures fun, and teaches valuable course material. People are mad because ""what he says in lecture doesn't help us with the projects"", yea, it doesn't. That is a common occurrence for higher-level CMSC courses. I guess none of those reviewers have gotten past CMSC351/CMSC330 yet.  Projects involve using code to extract text from websites, organizing it, and making graphs/visualizations out of the data to make a point. Do people actually expect Max to stand there for 90 minutes every lecture teaching us how to code in pandas? He showed us the basics then everything else builds on that. Making a pretty visualization is something google helps you with. I do think Max should provide us with documents with code examples relevant to the projects outside of lecture, which is something he currently does not do, otherwise I don't mind his teaching.

Max also uses his experience from working in the field to teach us and explain what is and is not relevant. I love knowing what topics are actually used in the field because I want to work in data science. Knowing what to expect means I can focus on certain topics more and do better on interviews. Everyone that is roasting Max for talking about his work in the field is an absolute donut that just wants to be spoon-fed code instead of learning topics at a high level and figuring out the code on their own. 

Max is also a very considerate and reasonable instructor that understands that students have a life outside of his class and is willing to accommodate for special circumstances. Very down to earth and likable dude",4
"Yeah anyone who gave him a 5 is a complete lunatic. I'll admit he has promise but for now he is currently teaching one of the worst run CS courses in the entire department. Nice guy, would love to get a beer with him some time but the course is so disorganized to the point where it makes learning horrible. He was adamant on changing the slides in the beginning of the year because they ""weren't good"" and now instead teaches off whatever tangents his brain works off of. I can't imagine how Jose feels as he recently revamped the course just to have it ruined by Max. Maybe once he sorts this all out he'll be better, but for now he deserves the 1, ignore anyone who gave him a 5.",0
"A pretty unorganized course to be honest, but it's his first semester teaching so it's to be expected. Only problem with this course is that there isn't enough code examples in class and the slides/notes are unorganized if there are any at all. Other than that, he's a cool guy and completely understanding/willing to take feedback. The 1-star reviewers are all crybaby's and think everything they need to know for this class needs to be spoon-fed to them like a little child. People even tried to take advantage of his kindness claiming the stat questions on the midterm shouldn't count because STAT400 isn't a prerequisite for this class. Well... if you made it through CMSC250 and can't solve a simple Bayes Equation question then I really don't know what to tell you.",2
Sucks. If you want to learn anything avoid him.,0
"terrible professor. picture this: jose, a very good and well respected professor, teaches this class the previous semester, takes his time to redo the course material, makes all these projects and slides, proper organized class. then max comes along, deletes all the slides, keeps the projects because he is too lazy to create new ones (he literally wont stop talking about how he has never even seen the projects) and whos lectures consist of word vomiting material he only has surface level knowledge on, then has exams that are designed to be googled on. he has amassed a weird bunch of groupies who will shill for whatever he says (hence all the 5 stars who sound like they were written by the same person). Do not take any class with this man",0
"The worst course I have ever taken! Attending lectures is a total waste of time because you cannot learn anything. You need to teach yourself everything when doing projects and reviewing for exams, and when you are taking the exam you need to google almost everything. If you want to pay a lot of tuition and gain the ability to be a self-learner, take this course with Max. Although Max is a nice professor, who likes talking about his success in the industry, this course is so unorganized and that is because he removed all the good slides from the previous semesters and wants to teach this course in his own way. 
The first exam was a nightmare.  The exam was not related to his lecture and we had no idea about what kinds of problems would be in the exam. He curved a lot to make up for that, but it still can't change the fact that we did not learn ANYTHING.",0
"AVOID. Not only learn nothing, but also take your time complete projects that are completely unrelated to the course content. Be prepared to spend hours understand the project and google.",0
"Ill break it down for everyone as best as I can.
Cons: 
- No lecture slides
- He has lecture notes he wrote, but only sometimes do they get posted
- The first midterm was a mess. He put a huge curve on it to make up for it though. 
- Not many code examples
Pros: 
- Relatable nerdy guy with stories from the industry (he is not a professional professor, he is data scientist with an insanly good resume) 
- Willing to do better as a professor, the first exam was a mess, the second one was not. If someone did bad on the second exam it was probably because they did nothing all semester. 
- Gives warm-up questions at the start of lectures which he describes as interview problems 

All in all, he is not the worst professor. The projects are related to the materials despite what some other peoples reviews are saying. The exam questions were related to the lectures, despite what some other reviews are saying. Do the projects require a lot of Googling? Yes, they do. There were not too many code examples given in the course but the documentation surronding what you are doing is actually really good. So, having to Google it, is not like shooting yourself in the foot. 

I'd say 4/5. There is room for improvement, but it could of been way worse. 

I found it was best to skip the in-person lecture as watching the recording of the lecture made taking notes easier as the lectures are actually him just talking to you and not reading off a slide show. So if you cannot take notes based on speech in a quick manner like myself, watch the recordings.",3
oh you thought 351 was the CS weed out class? think again and welcome to 320 with max,0
"did an oopsie woopsie with the first midterm, curved it to make up for it

projects are heavy on googling but its not terrible/pretty obvious what to do from the descriptions

second midterm was better written than the first, still relatively low average but imo questions were very googleable (which he hints as a solution for exam problems)",4
"This was genuinely one of my favorite courses at UMD. The lectures were a useful overview of tools available to data scientists, and the projects were realistic representations of what it's like to work with data. Max is a really fun lecturer and I highly recommend stopping by his OH to chat / get life advice. It's really unfortunate that so many people gave him bad ratings after the first midterm - he's a super reasonable guy and adjusted the rest of the course after receiving feedback and I don't think anyone can claim that he made the course unfair. Anyways, highly highly recommend taking him for 320!",4

"Max gave very interesting lectures and is a great presenter and I feel like I learned a lot in the course. He has a lot of experience in the field so he makes sure to focus on the things that people will need to be successful in their careers. He also gave lectures on important skills that aren't taught in Computer Science like ethics and how to talk to people. He makes the class feel like a safe space for everyone and is very accommodating.

His first test was very disorganized but he gave lots of extra credit to make up for it and worked things out with people who had problems on top of that. The second test was a lot better and he still let people talk him into extra credit for certain questions. The final project is one that will look good to employers and replaces any final test. There are 4 projects in the class that can take a bit of time to complete if you don't understand the tools but once you know how to use the them the projects don't take long at all. Overall, I highly recommend taking this class with him.",4
"Maks is a fun lecturer, as a data scientist who had worked in the industry he shared a lot of interesting stories relating to his experience with past jobs. However the class itself is disorganized, you have to rely heavily on the notes you take during class as he doesn't consistently have official class notes, and the exams didn't have any official practice questions other than student-made ones posted on Piazza. The projects rely heavily on your ability to google the right things as there's not much in the lectures dedicated on teaching students how to use Python other than a few mentions of some random Python methods here and there.
As this is his first semester teaching here he is willing to improve, he does listen to students' feedback. His second exam was much more fair and comprehensive compared to his first exam.",3
"So here's the thing - I don't think the 1-star grades are fair. Maks first and foremost is a genuinely nice person - this goes a long way. The only real issue with the class is the material covered in class is pretty orthogonal to the exams from what I understand

320 also has a reputation of being a very chill class so the departure from this I think makes a lot the ratings (unfairly in some sense) lower - he's a new professor and I truly think he wants everyone to do well.
Also just wanted to point out that the claim in an earlier review that the class material not corresponding with the tests/projects is common in upper level classes is completely wrong. I've taken 6 or 7 (I can't remember) 400 level CS courses - this has never been the case. 

I generally agree with the review left on 12/06/22",2
"This class started off very disorganized, as Max restructured the entire course curriculum. He taught what he thought was useful, and gave lots of stories about his time in industry and was clearly very experienced in the field. The big knock was that exam 1 was poorly structured, and even though I didn't agree and thought it was fine, he gave such a big curve that my 77% became a 110%. Projects were admittedly unrelated to most course content, but there was an emphasis on trying to learn how to Google, and they were easily manageable. Overall, nice professor and good class.",3
"This is Max's first semester and I definitely think he will improve as a professor, however I feel like I did not get as much out of this class as I had hoped. He doesn't really have any lecture notes, so sometimes it is hard to follow and know what is and isn't important in lecture. The only exam practice that is given are practice problems created by other students in the class, which is nice practice but gives you no direction about what you actually need to know for exams. He does curve exams pretty generously. He rarely answers Piazza posts, which can be pretty frustrating especially when questions that are asked days before projects are due are never answered. I feel like what we learn in class isn't super helpful with the projects, and I usually spend more time googling than I do coding. It's not too difficult to do well in this class, but unfortunately I don't feel like I have learned a ton. Outside of teaching, Max is a very nice guy and I can tell he genuinely wants everyone to do well in his class, and I think his classes will definitely get better after he gets more practice as a professor.",2
Every lecture was kinda scuffed but content was interesting and lot of topics were covered. Max is the chillest lecturer I've had. Definitely has GOAT potential. I'd give it 2 more semesters.,3
Good lectures. Reasonable grading.,4
"He definitely cares about his students and makes the effort to answer questions and improve our understanding of whatever he's lecturing. That being said, here are some general points about his class:
- He redid the CMSC320 curriculum in the beginning of the semester, but relevant lecture slides/notes and recordings sometimes weren't posted until weeks later 
- Projects and class material didn't really line up 
- The first exam had a really low average which led Maks to curve our grades (by a LOT). Second exam went by much better. We also had an opportunity for extra credit for each exam (posting an exam question on Piazza).
- No real practice exams or questions (outside of the questions posted for extra credit)
- He has prior knowledge working as a Data Scientist for places like Google and Ebay and tells us about his experiences there
- Grading is kind of slow -- 2/4 of the mini-projects still aren't graded (and one was turned in around a month ago)
- Googling is an important skill to have
- Maks is open to feedback, willing to improve, answers questions, will offer advice and ways to improve, and cares about his students

This was his first semester here though, and I definitely see things with him improving next semester.",3
"Will be good in 2-3 semesters. But for now he remains disorganized and uncoordinated with the material he teaches in lecture and what he expects from projects and exams.

Very reasonable guy however and generous curve was given for any mistakes. Once he figures out things I imagine he’ll be a great addition to the department.",2
"Disorganized course admittedly. However, he's a really nice guy and has definitely been trying his best. The biggest thing is that he's always willing to make up for things he's made mistakes with. He curved generously when the exams went (on average) poorly. I did abysmally on the first exam (failed it even after a 15% curve), because the class is harder with Max than it seems to have been with some other professors. The final project was interesting and topic selection was lenient (although grades took a while). I ended up with needing about 0.01% to get an A- and I emailed Max asking if he would round me up. He graciously rounded me all the way to an A (approximately a 3-4% bump iirc). 

Ultimately, you shouldn't *not* take a class because it's with Max. Even if you feel like you don't know what's going on during the class, your grade will reflect your understanding as relative to your peers. Give him a shot, sit in the front of the class, and you'll like him.",4
The class was a mess. Lectures kept getting sidetracked. We were never prepared for exams. Exams had weird grading. Grades took forever to come out.,0
"Overhated. He is a nice professor, and chances are if you ask him after lecture, he will accommodate you best he can. Exams could be somewhat challenging, so I recommend you find study groups and follow his study guides he releases. Like any CS course, most of my learning is from Googling and stackoverflow, so I can't really hate on him. He was lenient in the projects being turned in (we had an extra day for like 3 of them). I am sure he will get accustomed to everything in the Spring.",3
"I had him in the previous semester. Great guy, cares about his students. He makes class very engaging and tries his best to make sure students understand the material. Some issues did come up, but this was his first time teaching, some mistakes are expected. He also made sure that his mistakes didn't screw over students giving VERY generous curves on exams when they did happen (many of the negative reviews came immediately after the exam, before he announced the curve). For a normal exam with no mistakes, they can be pretty difficult but he also curves it up to an average of 75%. Overall I'd recommend this professor, I genuinely enjoyed his class and he's good at teaching imho. Giving 4 stars for the the mistakes, but I have no doubt that he could get 5 easily. Definitely one of the best CS professors at UMD. For reference, I'd personally put him next to Nelson and Jose Cauldron in ranking.",3
"Took the course in Fall 2022. He was very generous with the curve but I didn't feel like I learned much from his lectures. However, the projects were pretty fun and useful for getting some experience with data science. You can do something meaningful for the final project and add that to your resume as well.",2
"While we were spending hours working on Kruskal's homework, he didn't prepare for any single lecture. Everything was up to Kruskal so far, hopefully I can pass this class.",0
Makysm is specialized in data science not algorithms and especially not coteaching with kruskal. He struggles in trying to teach Kruskal's Concepts. He rambles in lectures with his Ipad trying to figure out Kruskal's content. No hate amazing lecturer for data science just not 351,0
"Maksym did a fantastic job with this course and made it the least stressful it could've been, given he had to coteach it with Kruskal. He genuinely cares a lot about his students, which shows in his effort! His teaching style is also really entertaining.
As Maksym gets more experience at UMD, I think he will easily become known as one of the best professors in the computer science department.",4
Max taught this course in his own way this semester and it worked out really well. Definitely didn't feel disorganized like people were saying about previous semesters and I feel like I learned a ton. Great professor with a lot of potential!,4
"Incredibly nice and caring man. Like incredibly nice and caring! Class is terribly organized because he himself seems a little disorganized but mainly because he cotaught 351 with Kruskal, whose class is always a mess. His lectures are pretty disorganized but if you pay attention to what he says he gives very very very helpful advice, but you have to listen to what he is saying. There weren't any slides which sucks. Averages on the Kruskal written exams were like in the mid to low 60s, but gave strong curves obviously. Great man, improving professor with lots of potential. CMSC 351 is made unnecessarily difficult when its Kruskals course. Not his fault for the class being bad.",3
"i've never had a teacher more open to feedback and thoughts than him. honestly the class kinda sucked but he clearly cares about the students and what their opinions are on everything going on. he always seems to try and do his best to figure out how to make us feel better and have a good experience in class (even tho again, class sucked but like hes a nice fella). it's a good enough reason alone to take him just cuz of how nice he is. he also curves very generously because of how aware he is that this class kinda sucks. 
his lectures felt pretty all over the place. he's a very engaging speaker and tries to make the class interactive so you wont be bored and your brain will be moving during it but most people i know and i primarily learned from kruskal's videos rather than maks' class just because of how messy it'd be sometimes. he'd get terms/content wrong and correct himself a lecture later, change up variables, explain things incorrectly, etc. it's probably just cuz he just started teaching here tho, he'll probably have  a much better grasp of the content and how to teach it by like a semester or two. it definitely felt like he didn't rehearse or think much abt how to convey new information, but again, he'll probably be good with time.  
honestly more of a 3.5/5 stars with my specific experience in this course but he'll def be like a 4 or 5 in a few semesters. i rounded up since he's jus a nice guy lol some people on here are too mean. pretty sure he reads these too",3
very generous with curves but unbelievably corny,3
"The reviews are all correct. Nice guy but just may be the worst professor of all time. Cancels class essentially when he feels like, has no guidelines for things, and just made the course and overall unpleasant experience with Kruskal.",0
"I've spoken to several TAs and Max wanted to teach the course using Justin's notes but was forced by the university to teach it with Kruskal (which as we all know, did NOT go well). His lectures didn't prepare us for Kruskal's midterms or homeworks, but then again, Kruskal is really specific in what he wants (I still do not understand why we had to know how to calculate the exact number of comparisons for each algorithm) and I doubt anyone can really teach 351 at the level Dr Kruskal does. It also takes WAY too long to get a homework back (they've actually got 320 TAs grading 351). Overall though, I think Max tried really hard, and he's giving us a generous curve, and he's still new. Give him time. I believe in him.",4
"Co-taught with kruskal, so I'll ignore many of the issues that come with his content

Pros:
- Super caring about students. He recognized that Kruskal runs a brutal class, and heavily curved and gave us hints for exams to make up for it
- He cares heavily about his assignments and their grades accurately reflecting the knowledge of his students. Since Kruskal's content doesn't do that, he put a lot of effort into making sure nobody failed the class unless they were extremely under the average. He went as far as to curve the average for the entire class up to an A at the end.

Cons:
- Severe lack of knowledge of the subject. Everything I learned came from Kruskal's recorded lectures
- Very disorganized. Didn't prepare for lectures, and basically tried to learn the content along with us

Definitely has potential to be an excellent professor when he makes his own content and lectures about stuff he knows about. Unfortunately, this semester was neither. I'm giving him a 4/5 for his extreme willingness to de-Kruskal the class by any means necessary.",3
"I wanna cut Maks some slack. It was his first semester co-teaching 351 with Dr. Kruskal.
Overall, it seemed that he didn't have much control over the course structure/material since it was his first time teaching. All decisions were ultimately up to Dr. Kruskal. 
I don't know the extent that Maks had over the HWs and Exams that were given to us. They all felt as though they were made by Dr. Kruskal.
The HWs and exams were insanely challenging. Averages for both midterms seemed to be around ~60%.

During lectures he taught us based on Dr. Kruskal's recorded lectures from previous semesters. Maks' lectures were very high-level though, so I still had to watch Dr.Kruskals lecture videos to know the full extent of the material and all the deeper math theory behind specific algorithms.

Hopefully, I can make it through this course with a passing grade. As of right now, right after our final, nobody can tell what their grades will be.
Maks has potential to be great though! He genuinely cares about his students and relates to us. So he understands the struggles and stress everybody went through this semester. I'm excited to see how he ends up structuring his course for semesters to come. He has the same teaching knowledge as Dr. Kruskal now, so he might be continuing the same curriculum but in his own revised way. Which I can say is definitely useful and important to know! I can definintely say I'm coming out of this course knowing the deeper math fundamentals behind algorithms. So take it with him if you want to learn a lot!",3
"Honestly, I think people are a bit hard on him here. Yes, he's a new teacher and has a lot of fine-tuning to do, but he does listen to student feedback and tries to accommodate student needs as much as possible if you just talk to him. For this course especially, it's easy to tell that he did not have much control over the course since he was co-teaching with kruskal, so a lot of the course's clumsiness can be attributed to that. But he's a much-needed breath of sympathetic fresh air in the CS department, and it's clear he cares a lot about the well-being of his students. He has everything he needs to become a great professor, just give the lad some time. And while he's still figuring things out he's never blamed his students for any resulting grade discrepancies and reassesses accordingly. I really don't think there's much more you can ask for, especially for his first semester teaching the course and having to coteach w kruskal.",3
"Trash, Trash, don't take it. He has some crazy cultists who sit at the front of the class every time, and the other students don't come to class all time. The exam is hard, don't take this course if you are not the crazy cultists.",0
"You are better off learning on your own then learning from his class. This makes sense because Max really wants his class to be geared towards practical industry skills, but it just translates to a bad class experience. The exams are very open ended, sometimes weirdly or vaguely worded, and generally just harder then they should be. The class material only really prepares you for the exams if his exact way of teaching works for you, and for most people it doesn't. Everything else in the class is graded very generously though. That being said, I would recommend taking this class with someone else if possible.",1
"Max is definitely not your standard CS professor, but do yourself a favor and take him anyways. You’ll leave this class feeling like you have a better understanding of what data science actually is, rather than a random assortment of knowledge that you have to regurgitate on exams to get an A(which is what a lot of CS classes are). On top of that, I’m almost certain he’s the nicest person in this department. He’s very understanding of the fact that we’re all stressed out college students, so he’s chill with deadlines as long as you reach out to him. He’s also a huge nerd and is incredibly funny. I found myself laughing constantly throughout his lectures(go to lecture, they’re fun). Also, go to his office hours or set up a meeting with him. This man has a lot of experience in industry, he’s well connected, and he’s a very approachable guy who wants to help everyone be the best version of themselves. You’re missing out if you don’t talk to him.
He’s not perfect. He sometimes makes promises he doesn’t keep, he doesn’t really have practice questions for exams, and it often seems like he put the lecture together the night before and hoped for the best. BUT he made up for everything and was willing to change his course policy any time we had an issue with something. 
TLDR: take him if you want a friendly professor who cares about you and wants you to be a competent person in industry. Don’t take him if you want a super structured, math-heavy course.",3
He’s the goat. I love what he did with the class,4
"An interesting, caring, and potentially great professor. This was his first semester teaching CMSC351, and he was co-teaching with Kruskal; so the semester was, as expected, brutal. However, he did genuinely try his best to accommodate the students.
Pros:
- Incredibly welcoming and lovely person: if you want advice, talk to someone openly, or review lecture contents, then come to his office. 
- Engaging and interactive: the lectures became more interesting (but it was a bit time-consuming, so he might not go over everything he needed to teach and told us to watch Kruskal's lectures)
- Understanding: Max curves the final grade generously, especially if you show efforts, such as coming to office hours for help consistently or showing up to class and participating in lectures, then he will most likely bump up your missing 1%.
Cons:
- Disorganized. Most of the contents I learned from this class were from Kruskal's videos and online resources. I hope Max could become more familiar with the topics over the summer and incorporate a structured approach to teaching in the future. For example, Max, if you're reading this, it would be helpful to have slides containing important notes for the class. While it's great to work through examples during the lecture, including them in the slides would save time (color-coded and animated). It would be ideal if the slides could be shared before or after the lecture.
- Exams. Just terrifying. Well, it's not Max's fault because Kruskal wrote them, but my midterms haunted me. 
- Grading. It was really slow this semester due to the complications with the TAs; but it will improve, hopefully.
Advices:
- If Kruskal is going to write the exams for Max's classes, then study the homework religiously. There were practice exams, but not really helpful. You should still do it for extra practices, but mostly focus on the homework of all the topics that would appear on the exam. 
- Go to office hours. The schedule needs improvement, but it's helpful.
- Study group. Yep! Teach each other and review together.",4
"Honestly it's kinda hard for me to fairly review Max given the class was co-taught with Kruskal but I'm doing it regardless to help people who may consider taking him.

Max is very genuine, caring and makes lectures engaging but his knowledge was shaky (for 351 at least).  His curves are also very generous so if you're interested in getting a good grade, having a nice professor, and don't want lectures to be boring you may like him. If you want to learn at a very deep level and don't mind sacrificing a good grade, Kruskal is for you. The class in general was very unorganized but both Max and Kruskal have that sort of history but unlike Kruskal, Max is new and seeking to improve. 

Down the line I can definitely see Max being one of the more favored professors but I think he is just having a rough start since he is still new. Ideally I would want to give a 5 star but the class was just so poorly run I cannot despite it might being Kruskal's fault.",3
"Honestly, this is the worst class I've ever taken. Max co-taught with Kruskal so it was a given that the content would be insanely hard and the class would be ridiculously disorganized. Max is a great guy though and he really cares about his students, and despite the mess that the class was, he really tried his best to help everybody succeed. Under this co-teaching situation, it was a disaster, but under different circumstances I'm sure he will be really good.",4
Exams were very hard but this professor is awesome.,4
"Nice guy that cares about his students and wants you to succeed. Seemed he was blind sighted by having to co-teach with Kruskal and wasn't prepared so lectures felt like that, very unprepared. He made up for it with a generous curve which was nice, a whole letter grade higher than Kruskals curve. 351 is a hard class, especially with Kruskal's material and exams but Max made that experience pleasant such that I don't think many people had to worry about failing. Unpopular opinion, Kruskal's content isn't bad nor are his lectures terrible but his exams are extremely difficult but that wasn't in Max's control really. Final average was a 52.5 percent.",3
"+ Great teaching style
+ Engaging
+ Great with communication to students

- Wasn’t prepared for lectures at times: Literally started watching another professors lecture video during his lecture to try to understand material
- Lied about the curve he would give this class for 2-3 months 
- Takes a while to respond to emails",1
"Absolutely would not recommend class with him. His projects were fine and fair, but lectures and exams were horrible. The class was so unorganized, exams were horribly made and had very low averages. There were a lot of people who got 50s and also people who got 100s on the second exam which clearly shows it was a horribly made exam. The second midterm was also right before classes ended making the final seem pointless. His lectures are bad but instead of improving them, he tells you to watch videos and read articles if you want to learn the material. His review sheets that he makes during class are scarily organized and a majority of the stuff he said was gonna be on the exam was not there, making it hard to trust the review sheets at all. Overall, would not recommend this class with him.",0
"Definitely not deserving of a 5-star because of his lack of organization and preparedness for lectures, but he definitely does try his best to make the class less painful with Kruskal. Honestly, if it wasn't for the fact that he co-taught with Kruskal, I'm pretty sure things would've been much smoother than they were this semester, but co-teaching with Kruskal obviously wasn't his own choice",2
The class was messy because of the co-teaching and he even acknowledged how disorganized and difficult the class was but he really cares for how his students performed and was open to change like recording lectures and posting notes online,4
"351 with Max was a beautiful disaster. 

First, the review of the class: Max co-taught with Kruskal since this was his first semester teaching 351. As a result, we got all of Kruskal’s exams and homework assignments which are notoriously difficult. Max did not have control over what was being taught and the difficulty of assessments since Kruskal was in charge, and as a result, he sometimes stumbled over content (it’s hard to keep up with a mad scientist). It honestly seems like Kruskal and Max hate each other (understandably so) since there was a lot of miscommunication throughout the semester. To pass this class, this is what I did: I showed up to Max’s lecture with the expectation of getting a simplified overview. I did have to supplement the content to keep up: Kruskal has pre-recorded videos that go into the content in depth, and I binge watched those videos and reviewed the homework’s a few days before the exams. The exams feel similar to the homework assignments, but at the same time they are different, so it felt like a big wildcard, and I found it better to just YOLO the exams than to stress about them. My mantra: take inspiration from the homework assignments and express your creativity on the exams. I had no idea what I was doing on any of the exams, but try to grab the “easy” points and think on your feet. 

Max as a lecturer: he’s naturally charismatic and has a geeky sense of humor. I feel like he genuinely wants the class to pass. Even though at times Max was confused, at least he was enthusiastic while being confused? He would drop hints about the exam topics during the review which was helpful to dial in on, and his encouragement to keep us going while we were all flopping was helpful. At the end of the semester, his cutoffs were a lot more generous than Kruskal’s. For example, Kruskal’s version of an A- was an 80.5% while Max’s version of an A- was 69%. 

TLDR: if Max ever teaches 351 with Kruskal again, take it with Max and hang on for dear life.",4
"Max is a great person, but maybe not the best professor when it comes to co-teaching with Kruskal. This is after-all because Kruskal is Kruskal. This was not worth the hours of stress that this class put me through (especially the final) because the exam structure itself was impossible (Kruskal said the average should be around 65%) and the major delay in grades. This saying this course is mainly a rant against the way Kruskal structured it, Max didn't have much say over the structure or content. He gave us a large curve, but this also was probably the worst class I've taken with the CS department (but its because of Kruskal not Max). In conclusion, Kruskal is the villain and Max was forced to join the dark side.",2
"Maksym's 351 was co-taught with Kruskal, and this whole class was basically run as Kruskal's class with Kruskal's homeworks and exams. Max was forced to co-teach with Kruskal, in which Max was not very happy with as far as I know, because Max had little to no control over the material. Kruskal and Max were both discontent at each other, because Max didn't want to follow what Kruskal does.

I think Kruskal's material is fine. His homeworks are definitely hard, but if you go to the TA's or especially Kruskal's office hours, they will explain what the problems mean. And that's really it, Kruskal's problems are all about understanding of the material. What this problem wants us to do, what this algorithm does, why this algorithm behaves such a way, what this problem accomplishes, and why this problem is relevant, etc. If you really understand that, then Kruskal's 351 homeworks and exams will come off pretty easy. As for the notorious last ""coding interview"" problem on the exams, if you can do Leetcode medium without difficulty, you will do well :). But jokes aside, these ""interview"" questions get a lot of hate because there's really no way to prepare or study for these questions, but like I said, if you understand what this problem is trying to accomplish, then they should come off pretty easy. It's all about critical thinking, testing you whether you can come up with an efficient solution, and you will get partial credit even when you write a brute force solution. Kruskal doesn't want you to write 50-100 line of code that does complex stuff, the solutions to his coding problems are always simple pseudocode. Kruskal may be very disorganized and just not good at administering class, but he is seriously one of the most knowledgeable people in the faculty, and you will learn a lot when you go to Kruskal's office hours. He's been teaching and researching algorithm and theory for decades, and it shows.

Now, onto Max. Like I said, Max wanted to go with Justin's material to teach his class, so him being forced to follow Kruskal's material was probably stressful for him. I'll give him credit for trying his best. He's definitely someone who wants his students to pass the class, although that is not evident in his teaching, but in the curve. He gave a lot more substantial curve than Kruskal's even when Kruskal's curve was pretty large, which was about one letter grade difference, although the pass/fail cutoff was comparable for both of them. Does Max teach well? Well, that's another matter.

I think the problem with Max is that he severely lacks knowledge on the material. It's not that Kruskal's material is different from Justin's or whatever, he just doesn't know the subject well enough to lecture it. I'm sure Max is very competent when it comes to an actual practice as an engineer given his career, but I think his teaching is very shallow, although he has potential to improve. I definitely think Max wants to become the next Justin, someone who is approachable to his students, explains the concepts well, and have the majority of his students get an A. The thing is, I barely learned anything from Max's lectures. Pretty much the entire knowledge I learned came from Kruskal's recorded lectures and his office hours. The difference in the level of quality in answers you get from Kruskal's office hours and Max's office hours is pretty significant. I definitely think that Max will improve a lot, but I can't say that I learned a lot from him.

Despite the co-teaching, there is a pretty huge difference in the philosophy of teaching 351 between Kruskal and Max. Kruskal emphasizes in thinking about the problems and how to solve them creatively. The problems may be challenging, but you gain so much once you solve them. The way Max seemingly wanted to run this class is like a standard class, where you just take notes and you can do well on the exam just from the rote memorization. The difference in the philosophy of the subject is probably why Max and Kruskal were so unhappy with each other. I personally think that critical thinking and understanding is much more crucial rather than simple regurgitation when it comes to algorithm and theory. This is probably why I learned a lot more from Kruskal and give him more credit than Max. But I think Max has a lot of potential and I definitely do see Max as a good lecturer in a few years.

One thing I will note about 351 is that it is very poorly structured and Max did his best for his first semester teaching it. It's not about exams taking 80%+ of the course but really more about the content of 351. 351 is too much math and analysis heavy, and I do wish the class teach more interesting stuff like dynamic programming instead of spending too much time on sorting algorithms, constructive induction, and NP etc. The way Kruskal structured 351 is pretty unique and arguably odd compared to algorithm classes at other CS schools, so I can definitely feel Max's frustration in having to be forced to teach that way only. But then again, the whole CS curriculum at UMD needs some fixing.",2
"Absolutely would not recommend class with him. His projects were fair and doable, but lectures and exams were horrible. The class was so unorganized, exams were horribly made and had very low averages. The second midterm was also right before classes ended making the final seem pointless. He seemed to acknowledge what was wrong or that the results were bad but then just kind of moved on.  His lectures are bad but instead of improving them, he tells you to watch videos and read articles. His review sheets that he makes during class are scarily organized and a majority of the stuff he said was gonna be on the exam was not there, making it hard to trust the review sheets at all. Overall, would not recommend this class with him.",0
"My only complaint is that the class is a bit disorganized. Other than that, I think he did an amazing job teaching the class. If you have a genuine interest in the content covered, you will do great.",4
Bro is so cool. Only lecture I attend.,4
"So I had Max for 320 last semester. I wrote a Piazza post 3/4 of the way through the semester, discussing the lack of organization, lack of resources, and how the exams were just bad. Majority of the class agreed to that post and he said he would address the feedback. He mentioned he would have dropped the final exam, but he didn't want to change the syllabus. He also did mention he would also drop the final for the following semester, especially since it would be redundant along with a final project. From what I hear, he did not do so. I would avoid Max and wait for a professor who can support students through the learning process rather than throwing the kitchen sink at them and seeing what sticks.",0
The communication in this class is extremely sporadic and homeworks were not nearly graded in time to review for exams; he frequently made mistakes during lectures and overall seemed unprepared for class.,0
"Max is nice but can be a bit arrogant and often makes mistakes in class. His slides are minimal, and he's proud of it, refusing to change them. Although he suggested Dr. Fardina's slides as those are really detailed. I wouldn't recommend taking his course.",0
"Maks is really nice and it's obvious that he is on our side, and knows how difficult the course is. His lectures are good and he posts the material afterwards which is helpful, however since the class is naturally difficult and hard to keep up with you should make sure you practice a lot on your own time to ensure you do good. The projects get progressively harder, so make sure you dont underestimate how long they take.",3
"Only lecture I never missed. Expect to get smoked on the exams, as they are unique in that they are very open ended. Often times there will be several different valid answers to a question, so do your best to deeply understand the topics. 
Slides are often bare. Provides recordings if you ask him. Most approachable professor I have had.",3
"Although this was Max's first semester teaching CMSC250, I can't recommend him in good conscience. Lectures are highly disorganized. He frequently shows up with mistakes in his prepared materials and makes several errors in most proofs that he attempts in class. The first midterm was ridiculously long and ended up with a 70-average and he only provided a curve after many students wrote several paragraph long requests via Piazza. Grading is a nightmare. We have a weekly problem set (which I believe are written by the TAs) which are often filled with unclear questions and/or typos. These problem sets take the instructors weeks, and sometimes months, to grade. On both midterms, we were tested on concepts that we had never actually been graded on yet since we were still waiting to get our submissions back. I fear this may be the case on our upcoming final exam too. He's also bad at replying to emails in a timely manner. Also, I don't think he gives good instructions to TAs since their responses on Piazza are very short, abrupt, and sometimes teeter on rude.",0
"Easily my favorite professor I've had at umd, and made me want to go into data science. The class is a bit disorganized, but exams and homework are pretty fair. Max has the only lecture that I actually looked forward to attending, he has so much knowledge to share about the actual industry (he's worked at google, ebay, etc), he's super chill and understanding of students, and a super entertaining dude. Can't speak for any of his other classes but 100% recommend taking 320 with him, class has been pretty easy. Definitely goat potential",4
"Lowkey I love Max. I understand the criticisms, but if you go to class, pay attention, and just try your best on exams its really really easy to get an A. Just take a look at his grade distribution. He really prioritizes students learning, which sometimes comes across as not caring about grades. Just have faith and wait for the curve.",4
"Max is a nice guy with decent career advice and industry knowledge and that's about it when it comes to his teaching. While his projects were insanely easy, they in no way prepared you for his exams. He expects people to have a deep understanding of the content but doesn't realize that to get to that point of deep understanding you need quality practice material and assignments that build up your knowledge. The lectures are incredibly surface level and showing up to class is a big waste of time, I found it hard to separate the word vomit/tangents from the important content. I didn't feel like I learned much in this class besides how to Google. Overall, I would recommend taking a different professor.",0
"Honestly, Max is not too bad as a professor. I have to admit that he wasn't my first choice for 250 because Kline was rated better, but I had to take him because of course conflicts. 
Take him. It's a easy course. Most of it is common sense. Sure, you'll be introduced to new stuff, but with Max it was pretty easy as a course. I saw my friends struggle with Telli and Kline, but I studied for about 7 hrs before each of Max's exams(including the final) and I did pretty well on all of them. Homeworks are graded extensively and we have discussion worksheets that are graded which I didn't love but overall he's fine.

Rocky start, but he's been learning to teach better and get more organized (in the first few classes he didn't even get the name of the course right) but now he makes powerpoints and goes over everything; it's good enough honestly. Make sure to read Justin's notes which are online because his whole structure was based on it. Good luck!",3
"Max is understanding and approachable, but I don't know if I would suggest taking one of his classes (or at least this class) based on his teaching style. Throughout the semester lectures were disorganized (got a little bit better towards the end, but still weren't great), and he would sometimes leave gaps in the steps of a problem/not do some problems since they were ""too annoying"" (but we would have to know how to do them). This semester, the class weights were 40% homework, 10% lab worksheets, 30% midterms (2 midterms), and 20% final. The homework problems were difficult, but you were able to get most done on your own (you have at least a week to do each of them) and if you had any questions about any of the problems you could go to office hours and the TAs would help you understand them better. The worksheets were every Wednesday and they were done in discussion (some TAs would go over how to do the problems, but mine didn't) and they were graded on completion. The midterms were fine for the most part, but on both midterms, there was a problem where very few people got them completely right (e.g only 5-10% of people got full credit for them) so your exam grade basically dropped a letter grade just from that one problem (on the first midterm that problem ended up getting dropped, but it was a special circumstance). Max also taught using Justin's notes (so you could have chosen to not attend lectures). 

I feel like the class would have been a lot better if Max learned the material ahead of time and planned the course in a way that would work for him (instead of using Justin's notes, there are pros and cons to not using Justin's notes though). I felt like he was learning the material/what he was teaching the day of or the night before the lecture because he often made mistakes when explaining/doing the problems in the lecture. I also felt like the class was being run by the TAs and Max (and this isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it felt like the TAs would tell him often what to do and what not to do.

I was going to give Max a higher rating, but the following reasons are why I didn't. The final was more challenging than the midterms and I would almost go as far as saying that some of the problems on the final were as hard as the homework problems. I also felt like there was a problem on the final that was just straight-up, not possible (maybe it's a skill issue, but it didn't seem possible to do based on what the question was asking). This leads me to another issue that I have with the class. Almost all homework assignments/review sheets that we had in the class had typos which is frustrating (since some problems are either impossible/completely different even with a slight change in wording). I will say that most typos were noticed and fixed quickly, but I don't think it should happen that often (this is a red flag for me because if typos happen that often are they reading/doing the problems beforehand?).

Max is a 10/10 person, but a 3/10 teacher in my opinion.",1
"Class is just a mess. Grading takes forever (Homework due late October still is not back yet) and Prof. Morawski doesn't seem to really care about that. Our final project was released extremely late and last homework was also released really late. Barely any communication about this. The last homework was released so late that we were basically expected to work on it over Thanksgiving break, when it was originally supposed to be due 2 weeks before break. None of the homework is that hard (IMO at least) but it's just annoying that you continuously have to check up to see if the professor has even released the homeworks when he's already behind schedule. 

Prof. Morawski also is just bad at teaching, plain and simple. Lectures seemed more like a stand up routine to him. As other reviewers said, the slides have minimal info, and equations are often wrong. There's no clear definitions for anything, you'll have to look elsewhere. Everything is taught in an example/high level way but you are expected to understand and replicate at a low detailed level. For example, with hypothesis tests, you will not find detailed definitions in the slides that include everything he wants you to know. You have to google these things or use the other prof's slides. This is kind of insane to me as Prof. Morawski has taught this class MULTIPLE times before. And, you can tell that he thinks his teaching style is superior to other professors, which is frankly hilarious as he also goes on about how he thinks he didn't explain things well or how the exams he wrote/gave us are bad exams.

Homeworks and projects always needed numerous corrections-- again, kind of ridiculous for a professor who has taught this class before. Good luck starting the homework early, because he will probably change multiple things in the first few days of homework release. 

Exams had questions where you were supposed to use your ""real world brain"" and think outside the box. What does this actually mean? Trick questions and ones that are long/confusingly worded for no reason. We had some tricky questions on things that he *explicitly* did not teach us previously due to cancelling class multiple times or having the other prof teach us for a class. I understand that he had to cancel class for personal issues, but I didn't think it was fair to have tough questions on concepts that he himself did not teach us.

Anyway, all of the below reviews are very accurate as to how you will feel about Prof. Morawksi. You will either be mildly irritated at his lack of organization and general lecture style, or you will become part of his fan club. No in between. You will not feel neutral about him.",0
"While Max himself is a great person, very funny professor, and super engaging, I'm not sure many people in the class enjoyed his teaching style and I'd recommend not taking him for CMSC250. Most of his lectures were incredibly unorganized, and his notes were never uploaded on time. He posted Justin's notes which helped a lot more than his own notes, so I guess that helped. There was very unclear communication between students and TAs about grades on homework and discussions, and most grades were entered after the exams that covered them. Fortunately I figured out most of the content on my own, but Max's lectures didn't really help much at all. I would try to take another professor if you could.",1
"Guys a G. Hilarious. He ACTUALLY WANTS US TO LEARN THE MATERIAL. He doesn't want the education to continue the way it is, where students can just cram for an exam and then forget about it. This leads to harder exams. Get over it. If you wanna take the easy way out take another major. If you go to class and PAY ATTENTION he shares useful information and knowledgeable insight to his experiences in the industry. My only complaint is his slides are pretty bad, but luckily he's coteaching with Fardina who has pretty excellent slides so as I study for the final I will be going off her slides. They are just more detailed. He should improve his slides because with just his slides it hard to know whats going on. If you care about learning and are interested in Data Science take Max. Its really entertaining due to Max being the way he is and pretty interesting content compared to some of the boring an useless CS classes I've taken here.",3
"Max's lectures are fairly unorganized, and he oftentimes goes off-topic. He is more engaging than the average CMSC professor.",1
"I thought this was the first time he was teaching this course (F23) so I was willing to excuse disorganization. Seeing as he's already done this before, this semester was inexcusable. If there is another professor available, take 320 with them. The class final project was somewhat of an afterthought and was just a 15% of your grade homework tacked on the end of the semester. It was Doctor Fardina's first time teaching the course, yet she put together a much better experience over the semester (specifically the last two exams: much higher average score on midterm 2 and allowed a formula sheet on the final/was very clear about what topics to review).",0
"TLDR: low-medium workload. Avoid him if you just want to get through 250 as painlessly as possible, take him if you don't mind dealing with a bit of BS for a fun and memorable professor. 
One common thread you'll see throughout Max's reviews is that the class is pretty disorganized, that held pretty true this semester too. He frequently made simple mistakes during lectures, had practice problems that were wrong or incomplete, and on occasion something on a homework or exam pops out way harder than it was supposed to. Grading speed was also a big issue, although the homeworks were much harder than the rest of the class/exams. I can see if you just want a straightforward professor who posts all their notes nice and neat, is consistent with teaching, and is generally predictable why you would not like Max. If, however, you commit to going to class and can deal with a little BS, you'll find him a very memorable professor who had the class bursting in applause for anything from getting basic arithmetic right to designating an entire exam problem extra credit. I genuinely enjoyed my time in the lecture, even through all the hiccups. If that's something you can see yourself doing, give him a try.",4
"he's VERY funny, but his slides are minimal and the tests were HARD.",2
"Nice guy, but can't teach and bad final. There was legit a problem on the final that was not doable.",0
"I guess it was his first time teaching but he's horrible during lectures, made so many mistakes, and is very unprepared. Towards the end of the semester good luck reaching out to him as well, he disappears on you and responds to like one piazza post every blue moon. Understandable because it gets busy but we students have questions and concerns. TA times were also posted but they come as they please. I guess if you're willing to self-teach yourself the grade distribution is pretty good.",0
"Runs an incredibly practical and applied data science class, which is super useful and unlike most other courses at umd (especially if you want to be an actual data scientist, you'll learn tons of things to put on your resume). This is my second course with Max, and the disorganization has definitely improved, but is still pretty bad. Regardless, it's clear that he LOVES this class, and he's incredibly knowledgeable on the subject (has industry experience at Google and some startups). Would definitely recommend if you can put up with the long wait time for grades to come in, and the generally disorganized course structure.",3
"Max is pretty mediocre, but an entertaining guy and his class isn't difficult. His lectures are somewhat poorly structured and he frequently makes mistakes while lecturing. Occasionally he'll admit he's not well-versed in what he's teaching at the moment. He often changes course policies at the whims of the TAs, which can be frustrating as students never know exactly what to expect. Overall the class isn't run very well. 

Moving on to his positives, he gives out weekly homework which is great practice material but not too difficult. There are lots of helpful third-party resources given to students so it's hard to get lost or fall behind. The midterm exams were both fair and easy, and the first one was curved up significantly. The final was long and difficult but had a heavy curve, I personally got above a 100 after the curve. 

Max is fine. Take him if there aren't better options available. 250 isn't a hard class, but with Max you'll have to put in most of the effort yourself to succeed. I think he has room to improve into a good prof if he puts more effort into class organization and consistency.",1
Nice guy but going to his class is useless because you can just get all the information needed from Fardinas slides and online. He writes nothing on his slides and doesn't post his recorded lectures unless you ask. The coding assignments weren't bad but to get full points you have to do more than what the directions are asking. He grades kinda easy and there are multiple opportunities to get extra credit. HIs exams are not formula or math-heavy.,2
"Overall, I think Max made data science my favorite course that I've taken here at UMD. There are still truths to some complaints here, but the positives are still far greater than the negatives and the way it's taught is so unique so I think people should still take this class with Max (or at least go to his 320 lectures when they happen, since they're quite interesting, humorous, and thought provoking).
First, the cons: Yes, the class was quite disorganized, we had an assignment due in October that wasn't graded until the last day of finals. Some problems were unclear or needed us to search up information on our own (but this research was very simple and not really an issue). He is unprepared sometimes; he mentioned some lectures went way faster than expected, or will forget to put something very important on slides, and also stopped posting recordings for lectures which made it a bit hard to study for exams. Additionally, he isn't the best at math, so he'll sometimes make mistakes on some slides or formulas, but in practice we hardly used formulas so this hardly disrupted the flow of the class. In terms of grades, the other section for Fall 2023 (with Fardina) was basically a guaranteed A (the average on Max's exams was about 77%, Fardina's average on exams was about 92%) so honestly, if grade is the [only] thing you care about, maybe you should take it with Fardina based on the stats.
But Max's section and thoughts have many positives: The overall grade for the regular assignments and final project (which were worth 55% of the class) was at 95% so no one really risked failing the class, and most of these took just around 2-4 hours to complete since there are lots of guides to do what was asked. Where Max really shines is in his lectures: they were the most consistently engaging ones that I've been through at the university, always getting people to ask questions, cracking jokes and being relatable on what being in CS is like. The way he teaches the course isn't just learning data science in how to design & execute an experiment, because he also notes where it's relevant and useful (he mentions how Goodhart's law is seen in practice through grade inflation, I wonder where this could be present...), what the industry currently uses in practice (how does Netflix or Amazon actually recommend things), and bringing his own industry experience to elaborate on what we would do working in data science. Additionally, he also goes on some important side tangents about other important topics, like critically thinking about what grades are, career advice and thinking about interviews, how to ingest ethics in practice, and other considerations in life that many other professors don't touch (he informally holds a group of people that learn more on these general life skills). In the end, the class is such a unique, refreshing, and positive experience that I'd advise everyone that can take 320 to take Max's section when he teaches it.",4
"I would not recommend him for this class at all. I had quite a bit of experience going into this class and as other reviews mention, it TRULY is disastrously organised. His slides were too minimal, and he would/could not explain concepts clearly (which he acknowledged) and then we'd be tested on minute details about those very concepts! His ""review guides"" would tell us we'd be tested on some topic, and that topic would never show up on the exam! He actually prides himself on his ""quirks"" but it's super annoying because it's too specific and not relevant. His office hours are also always filled with the same people chatting away so it's hard to ask him questions. I had him for 351 and I thought this course would be better but it's about the same. I don't think I learnt anything from him in either course.

He'll tell you cool stories about his time in the industry and that will usually be enough to distract you from the real problem that he doesn't know the content well enough to teach it. NEVER TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HIM!",0
"Possibly on the same level as Kruskal, and that tells you something.",0
"I had Max for 320 this semester (Fall 2023) and 351 last semester (Spring 2023), and all I can say is that he is a great lecturer that genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed when they go to the industry. Many students complain that his slides are not comprehensive and that we need to google most concepts to better prepare for exams. However, I would argue that this reflects exactly what data scientists (and most CS related jobs) are doing in the industry. You are just required to have a basic understanding of class concepts, so googling stuff and learning the basics isn't really that bad. Max's style of teaching prepares the students to better navigate real-world challenges and to not be always ""spoon-fed"" with information.

Regarding the coursework, Max's exams are essentially about two things: Demonstrating basic understanding and extending the class ideas to real-world situations. I didn't study a lot for exam 1 and the final, and I got an A in both of them. If you hope that you will get an A by memorizing concepts and not actually understanding how the algorithms work and the math behind them (in a general/basic level), do not take the class with Max.  However, I must mention that Max sometimes messes up exams, where the average would be 70% or less. Though, you can always get partial credit and extra credit in all of his exams and assignments. Also, you can always email Max about anything, including bumping up your grade to the next cutoff if you think you deserve it! In general, Max's classes are easy, and you will do just fine if you attend lectures and demonstrate basic understanding in exams.",4
"I felt extremely disappointed at the end of this course! It seems like Max always has fans who think he is cool, and obviously, his lectures were nice. But the exams were EXTREMELY difficult! The average of Mid 02 was extremely low, and he was absent for some classes ( he is was sick though). He promised to curve that exam and ended up curving NOTHING! Before that, he openly admitted to us that it was unfair, and it felt like everyone was depending on it. Extremely disappointed, as the overall average for Fardina's section was so much higher than ours, and as heard from that section, she was very considerate to the students' needs. Everyone talked about how cool he is, but no one says the reality - how disorganized and less affectionate he could be.",2
He is trying his best to reach Kruskal level. Do NOT take him as your professor. Anyone else would be better. He just gets worse and worse each semester (based on what I’ve read). Not a very understanding professor.,0
"My opinion:
He is not that bad as some of the 1-star reviews state, and also not as good as some of the 5-star reviews. He taught the class in a way that was different from what one would expect. The subjects taught in class are very simplified, so students are encouraged to do outside research on what you learn in class. The projects were really fun for me as for some of them we were free do implement them how we wanted to. On the other hand, the exams were quite difficult and required us to expand on what we have learned in class to a large extent.",2
"Don't get me wrong - he's a really nice and chill professor and takes his feedback into consideration. But, he is SO DISORGANIZED and that makes his lectures difficult to follow. He also seems unprepared coming during lecture and makes a handful of mistakes throughout. He came in once claiming how he had ""looked at these problems beforehand"" and ""knows how to solve them"" but as soon as he got stuck on one, he just skipped it with an ""ah whatever"" mentality. Also, his TAs (this semester) had a lot of attitude.....

Overall, it's not the end of the world if you get him as a professor, but just know that you'll have to put in a lot of effort.",2
"The class with Max is generally straightforward, especially the programming assignments; the homework on SQL and Pandas borders on trivial, and the later assignments simply require using some Python libraries and can be completed with the help of a wealth of online tutorials. A couple assignments involve writing a report, and while they can be graded rather subjectively, it's simple enough to manage a decent grade on them with a few hours work. Our final project was released quite late, and thus was reasonably easy and minimal in time required.

The exams are designed to be open ended and make you display true conceptual understanding, as opposed to simply regurgitating material from the slides; it's not clear how effective this model was, as the averages on the first midterm were very high but were below a C for the second. Regardless, all the exams are doable if you really think about what Max is asking you to answer (rather than assuming what he is asking based on how a normal CS exam might go).

Max is prone to going on tangents while lecturing, keeping track of his idiosyncrasies can be annoying when trying to submit work that meets his standards, and his slides are wholly unhelpful; in spite of all of that, if you follow along in class and spend a few hours studying for the exams you'll be fine. I ended up enjoying Max's teaching style as a whole, even if it could sometimes be strange or frustrating. Recommend.",3
"Nice and supportive professor. Often asks for feedback and does listen to his students. This semester wasn't his best since this is his first time teaching and he had some health problems. But I believe he does have a lot of potential and will improve. Also, I would say he needs to do better at working with his TAs instead of letting them make the homeworks and discussion worksheets.",3
"Max was an overall good professor. The start of the semester was incredibly rough as it was his first sem teaching the course and there was a lot of ambiguity as far as assignments went and what was expected of us in terms of proof structure and the detail to which we had to explain arguments. However, as the semester went on Max was very adamant about listening to feedback and implemented many of the suggestions we asked for, including extra credit and more detailed instructions for assignments. Overall he's a good professor who genuinely cares about his students and will listen to their suggestions.",3
"He is a quirky guy who has his funny moments but at the end of the day, is a terrible instructor and comes off as incredibly arrogant and annoying. Yes, his lectures are engaging, but for all the wrong reasons. He rambles on about his work and personal experiences but ends up teaching very little substance as a result. He takes pride in his slides for being minimal, which isn't a problem by itself. But when you combine minimal slides containing useless information and formatting and an instructor who rambles on about pointless topics the whole lecture, then it becomes a problem. 

Exams are not fair. He tells us that to do well on exams we need to have a deep level of understanding of the material and to think outside of the box, which again, isn't a problem by itself. But he never gives us practice material to achieve that, as the homeworks are super straightforward and generally unrelated in concepts to exams, and doesn't teach properly enough to expect that from us. This is evident from our exam 2 average, which was 69 percent. Comparing that to Fardina's class (the instructor he was co-teaching with), which was 86 percent, it becomes comically unfair. He also never curved because of that exam even though he said he would. He said he instead ""compensated"" by making the final a bit easier, which is funny because our final exam average was still low at 82 percent compared to Fardina's 96 percent. 

At least CMSC320 isn't too difficult conceptually, with much higher weightage on homework, and less on exams, allowing many students, including me, to barely manage to get a good grade. I just feel really bad for people who were stuck with him for CMSC250 and/or will be for CMSC351, because those are objectively two of the most conceptually difficult CS classes students will take, with high weightage on exams, and Max will do everything to make it even harder for you.",0
"not a bad professor, very cool and chill but his teaching style was a mess. lectures were just slide shows and sometimes hard to follow all the information given to beginners without practice. listened to student feedback throughout the semester and was flexible with exam dates. exams weren't hard but definitely need to study for them if you don't feel mastered at the topics. not the worst class, but it was very messy and unorganized, the TAs definitely made the class better to follow.",2
no way bro grades subjectively,1
"This is the first Professor and class where I felt exams weren't just based on memorizing information. The first exam taught me more in an hour than all of the other professor's notes all semester.

I really like these exams since they set us up to develop problem solving skills in the context of coding/jobs and it's definitely worth it if it costs us a couple points. The only issue I have with this is if the curve is based on both professor's classes, since one class had easier exams.

Apart from that Professor Morawski is very good at designing a course meant to actually teach you the concepts and the thought process rather than just regurgitating information that is hand-fed to you.",4
"Maksym is funny, but he is a mess of a professor. He's disorganized, chaotic, and EXTREMELY egotistical. Even if he messes up, don't expect an apology from him! I feel bad that everyone is comparing him to Justin but Justin's on a whole different league. Justin kids hit the lottery frfr.",0
I second what the person below me said,0
"literally a younger version of kruskal. funny and chill, but as the review below says, arrogant and annoying. also very messy and unreliable. bro yaps way too much and tbh i've been going to the TA's to learn the stuff.",0
"Max is goated, super down to Earth, very fun guy. He's a lot more human than most professors, and is much more likely to add curves and change class circumstances based off of feedback. He is also much more of a normal person than most professors, so while he might make some mistakes in lectures, he also teaches in a way that makes the content much easier to understand.",3
"Horrible teacher never take him. Bro tells us to attend different professors lectures, read their notes, and then study their practice materials but has the audacity to make his own exams when he's not capable of teaching the course. He should let the big boys like Justin handle the real work next time like making the exams.",0
"He isn't the worst professor in the CS department, but he's close. He has told us multiple times in lectures to review other professors notes, slides, or practice problems because he isn't able to explain or define the topics clearly himself. His exams are made to be tricky and he puts leetcode style questions throughout, making the exam obnoxiously difficult for no good reason. He is a funny and good guy personally, but is very disorganized and hard to follow during lectures. I would advise taking another professor for 351 if possible.",0
"Max has many issues which keep him from being worth taking at all. His first issue is that he is basically a glorified substitute teacher for the better professor who is Justin Wyss-Gallifent. All Max does is rehash his notes in a worse and confusing manor. He also takes the homeworks directly from Justin, so you begin to wonder what he actually does. Then when the exams come around you find out this is the only reason he wants to teach. He likes to make his exams as difficult and unorthodox as possible. He will put questions that were not remotely covered in class as he teaches the material from Justin's notes word for word and then tests us on questions he personally likes. The other problem is he puts very little effort into it as he just generates the questions using LeetCode then lets his TA's attempt to convince him out of giving some of the terrible questions that are generated. My main issue is that there is no textbook or notes provided from Max to learn how to do these weirder questions that he asks on the exam. Maybe for example if he made his own homework instead of just giving us Justin's, then we would be better prepared for his exams. Due to this 'co-teaching', which is basically copy and paste from Justin, we are prepared for Justin's exams and not Max's exams in the slightest. I would strongly advise against taking him for any class.",0
"I'd give this guy 0 stars if I could. His exams are insanely hard for no reason. He expects you to memorize every little minute thing that would never be useful in real life and his lectures suck. At least for cmsc351, he is teaching exactly the same content as another professor (Justin)... just worse and his exams are considerably more difficult. In the past for other classes he's tried to raise the grade requirement for the letter grades (as in an A- would be a 91 instead of a 90 and a 90 would be a B, a B- would be an 88 minimum instead of 87, etc.) and the only reason he didn't was because his TAs all organized against him doing it. He made an exam that had like 20 potential questions and his questions were so bad that the TAs ruled out 15 of them for being overly confusing and impossible to understand. He literally advises all of his students to go to the other professor's lectures and ""jokes"" about how bad of a lecturer he is. He's god awful, I genuinely cannot understate it. This man has singlehandedly caused me an insane amount of stress this semester. DO NOT TAKE HIM.",0
All these poor reviews are from people who don't put in the effort this class requires. Max is a chill guy and his exams are more than fair. My only negatives would be that he messes up his notes pretty often and that he has a bit of an ego.,2
"I didn't think 351 with Max was very difficult. I got an 84% on the second midterm despite doing ZERO studying ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (median was 79%). Still, I didn't enjoy this class because of Max's poor lecturing.

Max evidently cares little about 351, and this is reflected in his shallow lectures. This class was co-taught with Justin, and while I never attended Justin's lectures, I got the feeling that Max's lectures were simply a watered down, superficial version of Justin's lectures. As a result, I mainly relied on self-studying from Justin's notes.

Max still earns 3 stars because he is far from being a terrible professor, although I'm unsure exactly how much of my success is due to the class being co-taught by Justin. Overall, I do recommend Max as a professor.

Spring 2024",2
Amazing professor! The problem was me.,0
Puts a leetcode question on the end of an exam and expects us to know how to do a coding interview for a job instead of mastering the material learned in lecture and in homeworks. TERRIBLE LECTURER!,0
"Doesn't show up for lectures multiple times, relies on 1 TA to do everything. Lectures are horrible and puts leetcode coding interview question on the very first exam. WTF dude.",0
"Constantly changes the exam structures and is very disorganized. Thank god Justin was co-teaching so he posted his notes and stuff which we could use. The 3 midterms we had so far have has 3 totally different structures. Only good thing is for the midterms he gave good hints about what was gonna be asked. 
For the second and third midterm he made his own study material which helped. Maybe he's getting better as the semester progresses, but my grades are already bad due to having a hard time on what to expect. Hopefully he can improve the course in the future.",1
"Now if you have to take him, you'll live, but if you have any other options avoid like the plague. He's extremely disorganized, so much so that he doesn't even have a plan of what he's going to teach. Instead he goes to Justin's lectures, takes notes, and regurgitates them to us. He makes it very clear he doesn't know what he's doing. He has even admitted a few times that he didn't know how to solve some of our HW problems. His ego is extremely off-putting, he knows his exams are challenging and that we're not well prepared (both because of the lack of teaching and the lack of any type of practice materials in the format he's looking towards) but he laughs that we're frustrated with him. To put in perspective just how unpredictable his exams can be, he was going to DEDUCT points if we got a true or false question wrong because they're just ""free points"". I understand his teaching philosophy, rather than memorizing he wants us to understand things conceptually, but he doesn't have the skills to teach like that. I really wanted to like him, he can be funny at times, but most of the time he's just downright distracting and way too arrogant for his teaching style.",0
"Co-taught with Justin = copying off him and getting things wrong. Takes odd pride in hard exams, acts as if TAs have to hold him back. Take Justin at all costs",0
"I seriously don't understand why Max gets so much hate and rudeness. He's a funny and engaging lecturer who has a lot of experience and down-to-earth advice about the software industry and where 351 fits in. For context, I took 351 with Max in the Spring 24 when he was co-teaching with Justin. Half the piazza posts were Max students complaining that they couldn't be in Justin's class, or just complaining about the TA's, exams, or class in general which really rubbed me the wrong way and I assume most of these reviews were written by the same people.

Trying to be as unbiased as possible, here are my pros and cons for Max:

Pros
- Funny lecturer who will often regain your attention with a well-timed f bomb
- Adapts throughout the semester based on students needs (got rid of pseudocode questions on exams)
- Him and his TAs are very responsive on piazza (shoutout Elizabeth)
- Is very understanding with questions in class
- Lots of real world/tech job searching experience (former google employee)
- Can be manipulated to give you leniency (his words not mine)

Cons
- I'd argue that exams are unpredictable, not ""hard"" like everyone says. I whiffed on his first midterm with a 70 after studying throughout the week then got a 100 on the next with only a couple hours of studying.
- Had a little trouble explaining some concepts, seemed a little unprepared to lecture on the day's topic at times

P.S. the ""leetcode question"" people are alluding to in other reviews was to code the fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming, just worded a little differently. Climbing Stairs #70 on leetcode if you want to see how ""bad"" it was.",4
"This guy bro. He ""coteaches"" with Justin, this means Justin does all the teaching and provides the textbook as well as practice exams. Max provided a single practice exam for exam3 and that too without an answer key to study off of. Then when we finally take the exam they give us barely any partial credit (also don't specify to simplify a function then take off points regardless of equivalence) and the questions were completely unrelated to the content we consumed from Justin's notes, which as some of the other reviews also mention Max told us to use and go to Justin's lectures.

I honestly have no clue how he's being paid at this point he's farming free money from the university without putting in any effort into teaching or even making the tests. Taking this class with him makes me feel bad about paying my tuition knowing any of it is going to this guy.",0
"I would say Max is a very lenient and chill person, as he is very understanding of any problems you have and is very receptive to feedback. Since it was his first time teaching, I would say his lecturing style was pretty disorganized and mistakes were made, but I was able to understand the main concepts in the course. I would say it is fine if you get him for 250, just be ready for some lectures to be all over the place sometimes.",3
"If you were not able to take Justin, drop the class! Max doesn't even do the bare minimum when teaching, yet he goes out of his way to make exams extremely difficult. He wants to ""challenge"" you, but the execution is terrible. You go through the entire course reading Justin's notes, doing his homework, and practicing his practice exams, yet somehow you're supposed to understand the nonsense that Max puts on his exams. His exams are nothing like what you've practiced in the homework or practice exams. They're really long and theoretical based, which is basically impossible to do within 90 minutes. If you end up taking him, just know that you are not stupid. 351 is genuinely a hard course and Max just does anything he can to give you a hard time.",0
"- Disorganized 
- Exams are not hard, but are confusing
   - questions on exams test for irrelevant and unrelated material
   - rubric/point system for his exams express that you only need to get the exact answer down. Displaying a 90% understanding in the material results in 0 points.

All he does is regurgitate Justin's notes but he can't even do that well as he's always skipping over things. This honestly just show's how he's terrible at his job especially when his peers are significantly better professors.",0
"Overall, Maks is a really nice person who kept lecture fun and engaging. However he was never prepared to teach the material we had to go over, often deviated from his schedule, homeworks took a long time to grade, and discussion was close to useless since the problems were so much harder than exams and TAs often did not know how to do the problems themselves. The final exam was also super tricky and ended up having to be curved. I really wish he was a better teacher because his personality and enthusiasm about the subject is great, but he does not know how to write fair exams or run a class where students understand what is being taught.",1
idk why ppl hate on him so much! GOAT. he is someone u can talk to about anything and i get it his exams are hard but he tells u everything thats gonna be on the exam! u just need to attend his lectures thats something u wouldve done even if u had justin so not a big deal. i could be biased but this man is freakin amazing man. take him if u actually wanna learn how to solve problems cuz his exams focus more on how the algorithm performs so one never forgets what they've learned.,4
"In theory Max's class should create a better learning environment because he prioritizes actually understanding the concepts at a deeper level rather then just being able to 're-run' the algorithm on a new set of numbers. However in practice the class is terrible. He is a bad lecturer that gets off topic very often and copies straight from Justins notes. He teaches the same content as Justin and has the same HW, but creates his own exams. This makes it impossible to expect what type of difficult questions we can expect on the exam.",0
"Asks vague open ended questions on exams and expects you to think exactly like him. Consistently have to regrade request +10% points on every exam, you better pray your grader is having a good day.",1
"I started the semester liking Max as he seemed down-to-earth and funny. However, he quickly became arrogant and rude towards his students in a matter of weeks. He has made many jokes about how his exams are hard and he thinks it's funny that we are stressed as a result. I also went into his office hours to talk about my grade and he was super unwelcoming, basically rushing me to leave his office. 
Max puts little to no effort into this class as Justin prepares all lecture material and homeworks for him. He would often forget how to do something or explain a topic so badly that he had to pause class to reference Justin's notes. A few times, he even had to re-explain the topics during the next lecture. The one thing Max did do was write his own exams, which contained extremely hard questions and were pretty unfair based on the fact that Max students only had Justin type questions to practice with. (Justin would also give out 3-5 practice exams per midterm, while Max students would be lucky to receive a sloppy, last-minute thrown-together practice)
He has set up this class so it is extremely hard to get higher than a B-. It feels like every assignment has been graded subjectively, where graders are looking for any reason to take points from students. Max has also made it so that many of the homework and exam questions are graded all-or-nothing style with zero hope for regrades. Based on the fact that 83.3% of your grade in this course is based off of exams, exams are made based on what Max is feeling at the moment with little practice provided, and homeworks are graded as harshly as exams, Max does not have his students best interests at heart. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!",0
"Not the best when it comes to fair exams (compared to Justin, for example) but I did enjoy some of his lectures. Super fun to listen to about topics that he's interested in and his exams are, while grade-destroying, very interesting to look at in hindsight. It really forces you to understand the algorithms beyond memory, at least. He's a generally understanding guy though - if you talk to him about your concerns, he'll hear you out and give good advice on what to do and how to change what your current study methods are. 
TLDR: Take Max if you really want to be pushed beyond just understanding algorithms, but don't expect fair exams or clear/concise lectures.",2
"Max is a very engaging professor who loves to crack jokes and is more of a casual professor than a professional professor, he's just a guy. This could be a hit or miss for some but for me personally, I liked it as it made me take the class more as a sport than a super stressful life-changing course if that makes sense. I know some people are giving him loads of backlash about difficulty or disorganization but I feel that when he was co-teaching with Kruskal it shifted his perspectives a bit, so you have to wiggle around that.

Pros, Cons, Subjectives
!! I put a * next to the important parts which heavily impacted my experience. !!

Pros:
- Very down to earth.
* - The TAs are very good! They care (shoutout to Elizabeth Qiu) and are on our side for success. She even made a Spotify playlist for studying.
* - Tells you what will be on the exam quite literally. 
- As much as it doesn't seem so, he does listen to student feedback. There was a type of question most students disliked and Max has vowed never to give a question like that again. As of today before the final, he has not given us a question like that.
- In addition to student feedback, he also interacts with his students. One of the students made a drawing of Max, and that is now his piazza profile picture.
* - If you are into his more casual style, he likes to crack jokes or give some experience
- Responsive via piazza, and also pretty interactive there.
- If he did a really bad job explaining a topic in lecture and you were unfortunate enough to be in there, Max will acknowledge this and put out a recording of the following class which he hopes is much more clear. THIS ADDS A POINT: IF YOU TAKE MAX AND THERE IS ANOTHER SECTION WHICH TAKES PLACE AT A LATER TIME, TAKE IT! THE FIRST LECTURE MAX TEACHES IS PRONE TO MORE MISTAKES!
Cons:
* - As others said, he is very disorganized, he is still new at teaching the course.
* - If you are not into his more casual style, then you may not like him very much (or at all, he can talk a lot)
- Sometimes do not post notes, and no recordings unless you are sick. If you were to miss a topic, you will self-teach yourself (Abdul Bari is goated)
- Sometimes a review sheet is put out, but there won't be solutions, and students are forced to make an unofficial solutions page. 
- Sometimes misses his lectures and a TA teaches the lecture. Luckily, the TAs are very good! (Shoutout to Elizabeth and Lana).
* - I will say this again: IF YOU TAKE MAX AND THERE IS ANOTHER SECTION WHICH TAKES PLACE AT A LATER TIME, TAKE IT! THE FIRST LECTURE MAX TEACHES IS PRONE TO MORE MISTAKES!
Subjective:
* - While Max is very disorganized if you were to attend the lectures then everything seems to make sense. You are punished for not going to his lecture, especially since with the point that he tells you what is in the exam in terms of the layout, and the questions it will ask, you are missing quite a lot. I encourage you to go to lecture. It is very beneficial.
* - Exams can be very hard.  I was able to get good marks on exams 2 and 3 (95%>) but failed the first exam, like bombed, destroyed, so it averages out to a C+. The first exam was on the unfair side I feel (and so did everyone else, peep the reviews from 2024) and additionally the TAs had to convince Max to not put a couple more insanely hard questions. However, for the rest of the exams, Max tries to change it up to favor us. On exam 2, there were multiple choice which tank your grade if you got just a couple wrong so in exam 3, he avoided this by giving us more small questions that gave partial even if you were not fully right. This goes towards the pro I mentioned where he listens to feedback. 
* - In addition, I felt the exams were fair. THE WAY MAX MAKES HIS EXAM IS MORE THAN MEMORIZATION (Apart from master theorem)! Max loves conceptual questions so you must understand how and why something works instead of memorizing how to do something. I eventually learned how to think this way, but others won't be as fortunate.
* - Homework can be a pain because sometimes the stuff on the homework has not been taught because for us the homework was made by Justin. I don't know how this will go when Max starts teaching it fully by himself. Find a homework group! It makes homework very doable.
- No discussion personally was a plus, but I know others prefer having discussion to discuss topics more.
- Max is a swiftie. I don't know if this is important but probably worth putting. 
- The students will complain a lot (mainly exams), and for good reasons too. However, sometimes I see people justifying their bad grades from it when really the exams are pretty alright. Max and is way of exams just may be different than what we're used to. 
* - Yes, Max likes to tell us to look at Justin's notes but only because due to his disorganization, he wants us to look at more material. Additionally, he is relearning everything also which is why he encourages it as well, just so we get correct information. This could be bad for some as it may seem like a waste of time to go to a lecture. 

I was going to give 3 stars but I am giving 4 stars because I don't think we gave him a fair chance. He is trying his best and he adjusts the exams more in our favor, but designs his exams so that cramming is not beneficial. He also gives reviews, and good reviews too personally. He and his TAs take the time to give videos and exam logistics. I appreciate Max and his TAs for doing their best. The winning aspect for me is Max feels more human. He is not professional by all means but for me that made my experience much more enjoyable (but I know most may not like this). You have to get used to his exams and his teaching style (and accept that he will be messy and disorganized).",3
"He's definitely pretty bad as far as this class goes but I do feel most people are extra whiny when it comes to his class. Yes, he is a subpar lecturer in terms of his depth of knowledge on the topics and he usually goes to Justin's lecture and would attempt to replicate everything Justin did in his class but unsuccessfully. Yes, his exams are wildly inconsistent and generally more difficult than Justins (who's aren't, let's be real) who he co-taught with. However, part of the difficulty of the exams are because the HW's are all Justin's style and they don't prepare you for Max style exams. Now idk if this is his fault and if he even has the ability to interject and make sweeping changes to something like the HW but if the HW's were a little more theoretical than his exams would be easier. I had him for 250 and that class was a lot easier and smooth because you could usually redo the homework's for good exam practice. And of course, most people will cry about the infamous leetcode question that appeared on exam 1. There was enough outrage that the question ended up getting curved off and any points you got from it would be bonus points. His exams in general are very theoretical and don't allow you to rely on memorizing patterns of algorithms, unlike Justin who like any math teacher will simply change the numbers and give you the exact same problem again for an exam. I feel as though part of the issues are just the class structure because Max was fine for 250 when he could do everything his way. Frankly most professors will seem terrible when they have to stand next to Justin and teach the same class so it's not all his fault but still, he has his issues and I'd recommend to avoid",1
Greatest of all time.,4
Did not clarify an entire approach to an algorithm the day before the final exam. Take the other professor!,0
"Took this class in Fall 2023 and it's one of my favorite CS classes I've taken. Prior to this class I had no experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, or even Python. I think a lot of the negative reviews are because Max isn't a conventional teacher, which is understandable if that's what you're looking for. However, if you believe this is a subject that you might be interested in, then I think Max is the perfect teacher for it. Compared to Fardina's class, Max was much less concerned with the math and specific details behind many of the topics we learned. What he cared about what your conceptual understanding of the topics and how you would apply them to real applications like a true data scientists would. It's certainly hard to break out of the traditional test taking mindset, however I found that the projects were a great way to learn how to apply the topics.

TLDR: Unconventional teaching style in a good way, but if you have no desire to learn data science, do not take him.",4
"The ""coteaching"" was nonexistent, but I don't think that was bad. Max teaches you a much more intuition-based course than Justin, and consequently, it's much harder to study for, which people complain about. The only thing they shared was homework, and because Max teaches differently than Justin, this certainly led to issues and reading Justin's notes to understand a question.

Other than that, I enjoyed his class. The exams were fair but difficult, and it felt like they tested my knowledge rather than inane details of the algorithms. Overall, I think Max's class is more useful in the long term because you will remember most of what he taught you, as they are vibes rather than precise answers.

Also, the Piazza was great (shoutout to Elizabeth and her quick answers).",3
"Do not take Max if you can. This semester was co-taught with Justin. Sounds good, right? Well Max uses Justin's lecture notes which is fine - even if he always (and I mean always) made some mistakes in lecture. We also used Justin's homeworks, so everything seems to be great, right? Well in this class where the exams make up pretty much your entire grade, for some reason Max has decided that this is the one part of the course he wants to be original with. We get next to no preparation on the exams because all our homeworks are Justin's homeworks and while Justin generously gives his students previous semester exams to go back on and study with solutions attached, Max gave out nothing for the first exam, one practice with no solutions for exam 2 and 3, and only a review sheet for the final. It's not that I think Justin should scale back or that I'm not grateful that Max gave out at least something. It's the fact that Max's teaching does not prepare you for his exams. We learned additional topics and a different algorithm for Floyd's than Justin's class, yet the homeworks did not cover this because we were taking Justin's homeworks, and Max only uploads like half of his lecture notes for some reason. Not that his lecture notes help that much in the first place, when I look at his lecture notes I have to go and cross-reference Justin's notes if I can because Max teaches from Justin's notes most the time, yet his notes do not have in mind the fact that 90% of the things he writes is lost when reviewing them outside of lecture. I do not understand why Max insists on co-teaching with Justin just to give unique exams.

Max could've improved by realizing that it was probably detrimental to his students in create a separate exam from Justin for this semester at least. At the very least he could've put more effort into mirroring the amount of review material Justin gives, but I guess Max can do whatever he wants since at the end of the day, it is still his class. Even on the final exam Justin was very organized and gave his class the exact topics and weightings of said final exam questions, while Max on piazza said that the exam questions were ""chosen from a grab bag of the topics we've covered."" and that's pretty much all that we were given. 

I highly suggest you avoid this class with Max at all costs, or at least until Max shows improvement in understanding how to build good exams and prepare his students to excel on the exams instead of creating obscure exam questions which he thinks are interesting and expects us to do during a timed test. If you end up taking this class with Max, you will only be having a harder time. For people who do end up taking this class, whether by choice or by force, please be nice on Piazza, especially to the TA's. The TA's were here to help us do well and tried their best (remember that they are also students), yet they ended up taking most of the criticism this semester. The TA's already relayed the criticisms to the Professors, so reiterating the same critiques to the TA's did nothing and just caused more frustrations on their end. This also ended up cross contaminating with the 330 piazza which is just ultimately not ok. Max seemed to be very stubborn with how he taught the course so just save the TA's (and your time since complaining on piazza resulted in 0 change) some time and email the professor or talk to them on OH if you can.",0
"I honestly think he's quite a decent professor. He makes sure that you 'understand' and not memorize. Obviously the gears didn't perfectly align as he co-taught this course with Justin and some misalignment was bound to happen. But other than that, fair exams, fair homework, and fair lectures.",3
"you don't have to actually go to class. read the justin notes and then go to his class for the review sessions. he actually hands out the questions at the review sessions. learn the material well - not just surface well, actually know how everything works. AND PLEASE GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS. you will most likely get at least a B by just paying attention and understanding everything that he talks about in the review session.",4
Class is so disorganized and he makes his exams harder for zero reason. Avoid taking him,0
"Took him S24, when he co-taught with Justin.

So here’s the deal:
Max is nice, and he’s a decent lecturer. TAs being rough graders probably happens every semester, and it sucked

However:
- His exams have been wildly inconsistent in question style and point distribution, but overall the questions were weirdly phrased and not the kind we dealt with on the HW. The rubrics for the questions were not student-friendly. Be prepared to argue on gradescope.
- He almost got every ADS student’s final cancelled because he forgot to confirm it on time, which led to all of us scrambling over the weekend. He also once submitted an exam so late that ADS printed the previous exam and had to delay our testing by half an hour to get the right one.
- The material didn’t line up with what his co-prof taught, he didn’t record, and his notes were worthless. 

TLDR: funny and a good person, decent lecturer, but not good at the other aspects of being a professor.",2
"His lectures are mid but the complaining is overblown. It just looks bad when he's being compared to Justin, but I would highly advise attending Justin's lectures instead if he's coteaching, because his teaching is hard to follow and the notes he releases are really confusing.",2
"Max's lectures and notes often feel messy and incomplete in comparison to Justin's. I started off going to his lectures, and for simple topics, his lectures suffice. But for exams and most of the course material, you have to rely on Justin. My biggest grievance was like most students: from what I've gathered Max's exams were disproportionately harder than Justin's. I understand that most classes have professors who do things completely differently, but when you establish that you're co-teaching with him, I expect similarities whether it comes to exam difficulty, the method of the algorithms, notes, etc. He really wants you to understand the content on a deep level which I appreciate, but the exams punish you if you can't, and since this class is co-taught, it is kind of frustrating to hear when the neighboring professor's students are getting easier A's. Regardless though, a B and above is possible if you really grind so don't be discouraged if you're stuck with him.",1
"Warning: If you're looking at Spring 2024 semester reviews, you're gonna get a lot of bootlickers and people giving dramatic one-star reviews. Unfortunately they became very very vocal during the semester on Piazza and took over the entire class. So be aware when people are going overboard criticizing or praising Max.

Some people may not like his personality (not sure how to describe it, it can come off a little cocky), but he's a nice person. The issue is that his class is run like a disaster. Class notes don't get posted for months and they're fairly nonsensical to follow. He clearly makes no effort to prepare for lectures ahead of time; he made a ton of mistakes that caused lectures to contradict each other and cause a bunch of confusion unnecessarily. To add insult to injury, his UNDERGRADUATE teaching assistant taught better than him when he was absent. There were also some serious incidents involving TAs that got swept under the rug. Two TAs were straight up shit-talking students vocally and there were no repercussions except a ""hey, don't talk about that in office hours"" from him. The exams asked very vague questions that contradicted lecture material sometimes and oftentimes had multiple possible answers, but only one deemed correct. He also asked some questions about developing algorithms to solve problems. If we're going to get questions like that on exams, homework assignments or lectures should build those skills, as this is an analysis of algorithms course and it's not the main focus.

Max has his fans—I think it's great that he tries to build a community with interested students in such a large school. But I think he's emblematic of this UMD CS' institutional failures to provide consistent, quality instruction to undergraduates. That any instructor can exhibit such seemingly acute indifference to the material and helping students succeed is a total embarrassment to this university's claims of supposed high rankings and talented, accessible faculty.",1
"People will complain about the leetcode question, but his issue was missing lectures in key parts of the semester. Specifically, the last week of school. In a time where student seek last minute help or exam logistics, he went ghost. Lectures were watered down Justin lectures that lacked clarity.",0
"I don't get all the complaining. Sure he ain't the best professor in the world and some of tests were a little odd, but not expecting to actually do an algorithm is wild. All these kids complaining are mad they couldn't figure out a question on exam 1 where the answer was just the Fibonacci sequence! It's an algorithms class!",3
"Steer clear from him if possible. He doesn't teach very well (he ended multiple lectures with ""I don't think I taught that right"", told us he tried to do the homework and couldn't, and frequently skips problems mid way through because he can't complete them.) His exams are to ""show mastery of a topic"" but he himself barely scratches the surface while teaching. He doesn't give adequate practice material. He also has a terrible ego.",0
"Max is really disorganized and inexperienced as a lecturer. He frequently makes mistakes during lectures and seemingly doesn’t care about/understand 351 material as well as you’d expect. This makes the class significantly harder than it has to be, so I’d recommend relying on outside sources (such as Justin’s notes for 351) to learn the material. On the plus side, he is one of the more entertaining CS lecturers, his exams actually rely on applying the theory you have learned rather than memorization (some people don’t like this), and he is willing to take feedback. I’d recommend taking a different professor for most classes, but given that he has consistently improved over the two classes I’ve taken with him, he could be much better in the future.",2
"Ignore all these 1 star reviews, they’re probably the students that were complaining and causing drama in the course Piazza. Max is a great guy that is more personable than almost all the rest of the CS professors combined, with great knowledge about the course topics to boot. 

Sure, his class wasn’t even 40% as organized as Justin’s class, but what the people in this review section fail to realize is that Max and Justin’s exam averages were pretty similar, Justin’s averages being only 2% higher at most. The only discrepancy in this is exam 3, where which there was an 8% difference in averages, but I feel that Max recognized this and made the final exam a bit easier and more fair to compensate. Most of these reviews are complaining about a singular Leetcode problem on the first exam, which, in all regards, was unfair, but after that point, he swore to not include any more of those types of questions, or even pseudocode questions for that matter.

Max’s exams are different, in the sense that they test a lot on how well you can dissect a concept and see if you really understand it, which I think is a much better way of getting students to learn the content, as opposed to mindlessly doing problems as quickly and efficiently as possible. The people that leave reviews complaining about this are missing the point of his exams as a whole.",3
"steer SO fucking far away from this professor. like i mean run the other way if he even walks by you. this man is geniunely the laziest, sleaziest, worst lecturer ever. In my history of being in this university, this is the worst worst worst lecturer by far I have seen and it does not even come close. Cant even make his own homework and you have to do justins homeworks although justin has a completely different question style so his homeworks do not prepare you for the exams whatsoever(the first time you are exposed to his question style is in the exams, how lovely). LITERALLY IF YOU CANT GET ANY OTHER PROFESSOR BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM THEN DONT TAKE THE CLASS, JUST CALL IT AN L AND TAKE THE CLASS NEXT SEMESTER WITH A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR. i dont know how this man is allowed to work in any institution, hes not a professor hes a JOKE. he deserves -5 stars but unfortunately this isnt an option on planetterp.",0
"He doesn't show up to lectures lots of times for unknown reasons and even if he does, he has screwed up many times to the point of confusion. Also doesn't teach content thoroughly enough for his unreasonably difficult exams. I have put a lot of effort into this class and still felt like I fell entirely behind in his exams. For the final, he taught a different algorithm method from Justin, whom he was supposed to CO-TEACH with, as well as added multiple different algorithms from Justin. At that point, bro didn't even co-teach, and he made this decision in the middle of the semester which was very stressful. I am very grateful for the TAs in this class: I don't think I could've passed without them, but I can't help but think that the TAs in this class would be less stressed if Max was more organized. He's also lowkey annoying and arrogant.
If there was one good thing, it's nice that he put an emphasis on the conceptual aspect of this class, but this barely trumps all his downsides.",0
"He is a pretty unexperienced funny lecturer. Max took all the material from the main lecturer (Justin) and then proceeded to explain it in the way that he wanted, which was kind of sloppy at times. For instance, he would end class early because he considered there was nothing else to talk about (even though Justin's notes contained more material), he would have one of the worst handwriting I've ever seen, which did not make things easier (no offense), and he would run out of battery on his iPad in multiple occasions, interrupting the flow of the class. He would also talk about hypothetical scenarios in algorithms that he would just love to put on his exams, which ended up being more ambiguous than Justin's, leading to a lower average in every single one of his exams. The Piazza went crazy multiple times just because of his methods and the kind of questions that he would put on his exams.
Now, from a personal perspective, this was one of the hardest CS classes that I've taken. I just felt that no matter how much I studied for each exam, there would just be this set of questions that you would just not be prepared for, which was really frustrating. You would have the same homeworks as Justin's section, which saved my grade because I did really well on those, but they barely correlate with what you need to be prepared for in the exams (Which is 83% of your grade!!!). I ended up just barely passing the class despite having solid A's and B's in all my other classes and allocating significantly more time to this class.
This professor was just not for me, and I really tried to be as objective as possible here, as I see a lot of the reviews are just so emotionally charged.",1
"His exams are fairish (they are a lot more conceptual than other exams so you cannot just memorize the algorithm and do well, need to think), but only take the class with him if you know you can learn the material on your own. Bad lecturer and he seems like a friendly person, but you will eventually realize its a facade. Things to take note of that happened with him this semester: impossible question on the makeup for exam 1s (seemed like something went wrong in their exam making process, so prob won't happen again, but still good to know), often told students to go to the other professor's lecture if they didn't enjoy his, would mostly learn most of the stuff he was teaching during class (this wasn't as bad as it was in 250), not very passionate for the material. He did make some improvements since when he taught CMSC250, but still not good. I learned more from Justin's notes than his lectures. Honestly if he wasn't a bad lecturer and very arrogant/egotistical then I would've probably given him a high rating. I liked his exams.",0
"Don't listen to the reviews down below, people are over exaggerating how bad Max is. In actual honesty, max on the outside may be seen as tough due to the nature of the problems he gives on the exam, but on the inside, he's someone who deeply cares about making sure you truly understand the material taught in class by asking you questions which requires you to think deeply about the properties of the algos we learned in class. In terms of my performance, I skipped a lot of classes and procrastinated last minute for majority of the class so that didn't help in terms of my grade but I currently dont know there is a curve so my grade could be higher. However, in terms of teaching he's decent for the most part except for the fact that he basically banks of Justin's lectures/HWs. In terms of exams, the content was split into 40 - 50 percent ""Justin"" style problems which is just performing the algo such as run one iteration of quick sort, run prims, etc which are basically free points and the rest were conceptual problems which test how well you actually understand the algos. Overall, Max is fine and definitely not as bad as people make him out to be and if I wasn't a major dumbass, I could've done better overall.",3

Made 351 so easy. Love this guy,4
"A class of all time.

As the below reviews have already said, his teaching is basically him reading off of Justin's notes (not it). His tests are well ... interesting? They're definitely the most unique tests I've ever seen and are way more conceptual. People did get very annoyed at his first test due to a certain question, and he changed his future tests to account for that. Still, I found the class, in general, to just be so stressful due to the fact that the tests are 5/6 of your grade. He is sometimes funny during lectures, but also half the time it comes off as sorta egoish (as the below reviews also say).",1
"Beautifully chaotic class. Lectures aren't too great for learning and is honestly more worth to study off of Justin's op notes, but I will say Max's lectures have a very inclusive feel with his quirky and funny personality. Records lectures but you need to email him for it to promote more people coming to class.

This semester, despite co-teaching Justin's class, Max decided to do his own thing. This includes straight up teaching a few different material  than Justin, even teaching one concept his own way that is required for the exam, and creating completely different exams which were noticably more difficult to study for. His first exam had a leetcode problem that was told in advance to only those attending his lectures, his second one had a large proportion of your grade in a few mc questions, and his third one was half straightforward do the algorithm types of questions while the other half were difficult conceptual questions. The third exams format was the same style as the final, which was really well written in a way that actually makes you think.

Tldr: Take this class if you are low-key a masochist and like more challenging exams that are less on regurgitating info and more conceptual thinking.",2
"He's not the most organized lecturer but he cares more about your understanding of the material than your memorization of trivial items. I really liked his exams because in order to do well on them, you had to actually fully understand the material, and not just regurgitate a formula memorized in class. The leetcode question that other people are referring to is a question Max gave us very fair warning about (he basically told us it would be a DP leetcode easy) of which there are only a few. So if you practiced those beforehand (or even tried to figure it out on the exam), you likely would have gotten it. Overall his exams really made you think hard about the content that you learned, which is arguably more valuable of a skill than, say, memorizing time complexities without understanding WHY they are what they are. This guy gets too much hate.",3
"Max is a good professor, yes his exams are hard to study for but if you throughly study the course content you will be fine on the exams and they likely become questions you think about. 351 is difficult class, I would not say he is the best lecturer but he goes out of his way to aid students that are struggling and guides you in the right direction if you are struggling. Half the people complaining did not go to lecture regularly (where he literally gives out some of the exam answers if you pay attention) or speak to him personally which is not hard to do because he is a cool dude. If these kids had kruskal they might not even hit 30% let alone pass",4
"Max is a fine professor, might not be the best lecturer but his exams are definitely not as hard as people are making it seem. If you studied the course content throughly you would likely come up across some of the stuff we were tested on. most of the people complaining didnt show up to lecture (where he literally gives out exam answers if your paying attention) or try to talk to him personally which is not hard to do because hes a cool guy. he actively goes out of his way to help students that are struggling including me at the beginning of the semester, 351 is a hard class, but the amount of people complaining this semester wouldn't peak at 25% in kruskal let alone pass",3
"Max is a really nice guy but he's a terrible professor and tries to make up for it by trying to seem like our friend. He seems really smart but can't articulate ideas properly. Multiple times, he would try to lecture on a topic, forget/not know how to explain, and then just say forget about it it's not on the exam or to refer to Justin's notes. After the first exam, I stopped going to class altogether because it was completely useless. Furthermore, his handwriting and lecture notes are terrible and therefore impossible to follow. Ultimately, you end up reading Justin's notes to teach yourself all the material. This class was supposed to be cotaught so this shouldn't be an issue. However, despite Max's inability to teach, he wants to be quirky and ask us questions that are not reflective of the material we learn all semester. Though the class is cotaught, the only similarities between Justin and Max are the homeworks, which are common between the two. The problem here is that Max makes his own exams despite using Justin's homework but doesn't give us proper practice so you can't really prepare for Max exams when you are studying. All these issues led to a massive grade discrepancy on each of the midterms between Justin and Max(totaled to about -7-8% of ur final grade if you took Max). He did not release his final averages so I can't really say too much about that but throughout the semester, it was blatant how unfair the class was and how unreceptive Max was overall. This would all be ok if Max decided to account for this discrepancy when setting grade cutoffs at the end of the semester to ""equalize"" a class that is cotaught and should be equalized regardless. However, Max being max dropped grade cutoffs by about 2% meaning that you were at about a 5-6% disadvantage if you took Max vs Justin. Max is a nice guy but do not take him for any class if you care for your GPA at all",1
his exams are so unrelated to lecture materials,1
"Funny guy. Was ""co teaching"" with Justin. We had the same homework as Justin. However, instead of making the exams have a connection to the homework, like Justin's exams, Max wanted to be different the entire semester, resulting in lower exam averages, especially comparing to Justin students.",0
"Trying to accurately reflect on CMSC351 with Max is a challenging endeavor.  It'd be far too easy to say something like ""Max not Justin despite coteaching, therefore bad.""  I don't think it's that simple, especially since I already don't have the highest opinion of Justin for CMSC351.

First things first, lectures.  Currently, Max just doesn't pull off taking notes live during lecture like Justin does.  He often spends a lot of time during lecture just on taking notes, presumably from his own reference.  This takes away time he could be using to properly work through examples, since he is fairly unclear and/or makes mistakes on some of the examples in lecture.  I don't think Max is experienced enough with the material to pull off live note-taking without sacrificing something else about the lecture.  I think lectures would be much better if he mainly used slides for introducing material, and worked out examples live to emphasize the major takeaways.  Max certainly has the energy to be a good lecturer, but the lectures this semester weren't great.  It doesn't help Max's case that he was out for many lectures where one of the head TAs, Lana, took over, and honestly I thought she was a much better lecturer.

Next, the inconsistency with Justin.  I could whine about exams here, but I'll save that for a bit.  My main issue with inconsistency actually comes with the different notions Justin and Max used for a few of the algorithms.  Two notably come to mind: Dijkstra's and Floyd's.  In a cotaught class, even if the exams are different, I believe that the content taught across the two sections should be the same at the very least.  With Dijkstra's, Justin's notes, lectures, and psuedocode were very clear about how the algorithm should be interpreted in the context of the class, which is done to get everyone on the same page when doing Dijkstra's algorithm problems on homework and exams.  Max's students needed to know Justin's interpretation because we had Justin's homework throughout the course.  It was very clear that Justin's interpretation of the algorithm records the shortest path between the start node and every other node reachable in the graph, whereas Max's interpretation has the algorithm stop upon reaching a destination node.  I actually brought this up, which Max agreed with me, and both interpretations were made acceptable for that problem on exam 3.  Something in the same vein happened with Floyd's algorithm, where Justin's interpretation had a ""Pass By"" for each node in the graph, where Max's was something completely different.  This wasn't the worst thing in the world, because the Floyd's algorithm problem on Max's final was explicit in exactly what it wanted (shortest paths of every node to every node where the maximum number of edges on each path is 2).  However, the sentiment is the same.  Something related to this point is that Max's section did not cover shortest path algorithm, but covered bucket sort where Justin didn't... for some reason...

Alright, now it's time for exams.  Simply put, these exams were very experimental, and they did not work with Justin's grade weights of 1/6 homework, 1/6 per semester exam, and 1/3 final.  The first exam was structured very similarly to a Justin exam, except with a Leetcode easy at the end.  Oddly enough, this was the only exam I got an A on, despite the fact that I'm typically horrendous at Leetcode.  Regardless, people were vocal about despising it, so Max changed the exam structure entirely for the following exams.  Each of the following exams had a few Justin-style ""run through the algorithm"" questions, but were majorly based on more theoretical questions which I turned out to be terrible at.  Exam 2 had 30% of its score determined by 6 multiple choice questions, and some of the questions were poorly written and/or relied on knowing niche facts before you could even come close to a valid response.  Exam 3 was mostly fine, but two questions in particular emphasized memory, which isn't something we really practiced in class in any capacity.  The final was mostly fine, but a few of the questions were weighted a crazy amount, and there were a fair amount of gotchas with small, but significant point reductions throughout the exam.  I did not clutch up on the final, and I screwed up so much compared to how I wanted to do that I only qualified for an A- with a small unknown curve.  I'll take it, but at the same time I wanted to do better in this course, but I didn't know how to prepare for the exams.  I'll accept that this is a pretty big skill issue, since the exam distributions throughout the semester were honestly pretty high for both professors (Justin's were typically a few points higher on the mean, with exam 3 having an 8 percent mean disparity, but Max's averages weren't bad).  However, I also don't think this class structure was setting most people up for success, and it didn't seem that we were given much leeway while Max was figuring out what he wanted his exams to be like.  It's honestly a shame, because I can see what Max was going for with the exams.  But they simply don't work with the grade weights we were given, and after exam 1, they were mostly independent from Justin's homework which we had to do throughout the semester.

I'm conflicted.  I want to give Max a higher rating, because I genuinely believe that this class wasn't designed to hurt the students.  Max may have some amount of arrogance or whatever, but he is genuinely willing to hear you out on issues you may have, especially if you have valid points when it comes to regrades (personal experience).  However, what keeps my rating low is that this run of CMSC351 was just rough.  I feel like a lot of decisions were made just to be made, rather than for the benefit of the students.  In a sense, it was almost like taking two different algorithms classes in the same semester.  For homeworks, we had to be good at Justin-style questions, which tended to be very specific in what they were asking and the answers they wanted.  For exams, we had to be good at Max-style questions, which tended to be far more vague and/or theoretical, but the answers they expected were still very specific.  It was very tiring.",1
"I lowkey didn't mind him. He gave really good hints about what was going to be on the exams and exams were more about knowing the algorithms in a high level than just knowing how to execute them. First exam was bad for me because I didn't go to lectures but after that I started going and he used to tell you everything you might need for an exam. That being said he is a bit disorganized and does go off topic at times. 
The grade overall was curved by 2%.
My fav part of the class: Piazza going crazy after each exam lol",3
"Max is great, nothing more to say. The class is not difficult, and Max is one of the most personable professors I've had here. Homeworks and exams are simple and straightforward, and the material isn't hard. Max is an interesting experience, and you will learn the material from his class.",4
"Props on this dude for having a very distinct teaching philosophy lol!! I unfortunately do not vibe with him, which is probably a teller of what kind of brain I have as well (abstract theory maybe isn't my best suite). He's a cool guy that occasionally cusses during lectures, but his teaching style is ultimately sort of disheveled and unclear. Though, I do have to give him credit for telling us what kinds of questions will be on the midterms/finals prior (which was most likely a product of the first exam -- an utter catastrophe went on in the Piazza).",1
"Max does have a bit of an ego and he clearly doesn't care too much for 351, but he's always willing to hear you out and talk through any concerns you may have. I also appreciate his office hours when he's there - he explains things over and over again if you don't listen (ex. I asked him to explain 3-SAT since he hinted it might be on the final and I did not understand it, and he took over 20 minutes to explain it again and again to me and the students who stopped by to listen). His exams are pretty tough and a bit of a shock at first (I bombed the first midterm and spent the rest of the semester dragging my grade back up lol), but looking back, I find that I liked how they were written. It's less repeating what you memorized and more applying what you learned, which I think is very useful.",2
"He was co-teaching with Justin. We used Justin hws and lectures. Only difference Max wrote the exams. The only problem was Max was trying to be different and made the exams something you cant really study for and not have a strong connection with the homeworks. For 351 exams make 85% of the class weight in total, with that in mind, I did really well on the Hws and Justin practice exams, but failed the class because of Maxs stupid ass.",0
Would rather cross a road blindfolded than take a class with him.,0
"Max knows his topics well besides some small mistakes here and there. The class would have been better if Max was more organized, he runs very disorganized day to day, and that trickles down to how he runs his courses. I also would have appreciated in-person office hours with the TAs, and I am sure some others would have appreciated this. I recommend going to practice sessions if you want a better grade in the course. His tests are decently tricky, but he curves the tests and allows those who know the topic well to get ahead. I would take him again, just plan to use either Justin's notes or another source of practice to excel in his class, and plan for somewhat long tangent discussions in class.",3
"Not a bad professor. He is disorganized and tends to ramble sometimes. He does care about his students although it wouldn't hurt him to be more responsive to students who need help in time to apply it to tests. He genuinely knows the content well and uses references to real-life examples to make the class engaging. However, his exams are somewhat hard and worth almost all of the grade. However, he does boost grades significantly and is generous when it comes to rounding off grades. I would take him again, just be prepared to use another source of notes because he isn't the best with releasing timely practice.",3
"Not very good at teaching. Copying most lectures from Justin is one thing but not explaining them well is worse. Added a version of bucket sort to our portions which essentially worked as counting sort to have some differentiation from Justin's course. Midterms were not hard, final was challenging but fair.
Would not recommend because it's a coin flip on whether exams will be easy or hard and whether you'll understand anything very well. The guy often pauses during his lectures and says ""I'm kind of butchering this explanation"" or something along those lines. Being self aware does not help us.",2
"Chill guy, has a passion for his subject.",4
"Very knowledgable and has genuine curiosity for data science. His lectures are a little scattered brained and he could take a little more time to review the technical parts more in depth, but overall he keeps the material entertaining and relevant. His quizzes test critical thinking, not a multiple choice memorization style. Gives a lot of opportunities to make up points, but is maybe too lenient on standards. He needs to use the ELMS platform more effectively, he just throws everything into files instead of building the modules and assignment pages.",4
Super easy class. You can use your phone and cheat on all quizzes. Nobody cares. Easiest A and no studying required.,4
"He is pretty knowledgeable but explains almost every concept very poorly (almost like he's forcing himself to use bigger words than he should). The class was very disorganized: we were told there would be about 8 projects and 2 in-class assignments (basically quizzes), but it ended up only being 5 homeworks and 1 in-class assignment—take this as you will. 
Not only are his lectures hard to understand, but he also prides himself on making EXTREMELY DIFFICULT EXAMS that are often very vague or open-ended, in all the wrong ways. He masquerades this by claiming that it's better to truly know the content deeply while making questions somehow subjective (which does the opposite btw) and by claiming that it'll be helpful in the workforce. 
The only reedamble parts of this class and the professor overall are that the homeworks were generally pretty easy and that he is a nice guy at heart. 
Overall, since he doesn't teach you how to use Python, pandas, or SQL but basically all homeworks regard these, I wouldn't recommend unless (1) you really want to take this class, (2) think you can success in spite of everything I've said, or (3) LOVE DATA SCIENCE.",1
"Pretty polarizing.

This review is coming from the perspective of someone who also had Max for 351, so there will be many comparisons. But overall honestly, I think Max has the potential to get somewhat better over time, though this semester was kinda scuffed.

Max always said in class that he was more interested in data science than algorithms, but I was somewhat doubtful about whether taking 320 with Max would actually be better. Turns out it is... kind of. This class in general is much easier than CMSC351, so that's one thing for starters. There's a large buffer for your grade in 46% of assignments in the final grade. As the review below mentions, there were many more planned assignments, and they never happened: which wasn't that surprising, given that two (or really one tbh) of the assignments were extremely long.

Tests are hit or miss. Coming from 351, there are basically no ""Justin"" questions (it's almost all Max-y, but there are some questions that are much more direct and less abstract). The first test was highly curved due to poor writing, and honestly, this is something I disliked more than anything besides the abstractness (I honestly found their abstract nature fun at points). Questions are purposely vague, and likely to make you think, but it makes it really easy to misread or gauge a question's intent incorrectly.

Now, onto what I think could get better. The 1st assignment was writing... which was fairly useless, and Max realized this for next semester. The second assignment was fairly standard pandas/SQL stuff, but the 3rd assignment is where it got interesting. The 3rd assignment is honestly the best assignment in CS I've gotten ever, which I'm surprised I'm saying. It is VERY messy and very unclear, but that's partially the point, it is honestly the best way to learn stuff, and honestly reminded me of my past work/personal project experience. Probably the best assignment to actually learn, even if it was unforgiving and took forever.

I really wish the next 2 assignments had this caliber, but they were quite mundane. I know some people might think I'm crazy for suggesting that he add more assignments like HW3, but I honestly think assignments like those are probably the best way to genuinely learn about data science. 

Another problem with the homework was that ending concepts didn't really have that much focus in the last assignments, but I also realized that it would have been hard to create interesting homework based on those concepts.

Extra credit was quite scuffed this semester. Max initially made it 0.01% of the final grade, and just to put into reference how small this was: 3 notes was supposed to be 0.01%, and he changed it to be 0.05% PER NOTE. That's a 15x change, and frankly, it goes to show how little it was worth (and people thus didn't care much). Again, I do think this will hopefully get better with time.

Max's teaching style is sort of like how he was in 351, though he definitely was generally more knowledgeable about the concepts he was teaching (definitely not perfect though). It seems he didn't really care enough to make coherent slides, which led to really vague and hard-to-understand slideshows if you didn't attend the lecture. I think this is probably the most iffy point I have on Max that prevents me from giving him a higher rating because while I do think he will probably change the extra credit system/assignments, I am not sure if he will improve his teaching.

Overall though, I'd say Max is a slight upgrade from how he was in 351. As I said, comparatively to 351, this class is nowhere near as hard, though still somewhat poorly managed. Yet, there are some slight shimmers of something great, that makes the class somewhat valuable: maybe not for everyone, but definitely to some.",2
"I had this guy for 351 and somehow he got a lower rating from me for 320 than that class AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. At least in 351, I walked out feeling like I knew how to apply the algorithms. It was disorganized, but it was fine. 320 however....I got a higher grade but I got majorly screwed by the final because it was essentially a midterm 3 on topics he just likes to skate over instead of actually covering in a structured method. Maybe I would have done fine if the rubric wasn't also all or nothing style with 4 points for some questions. Exams are so weird and the grades keep fluctuating because it turns out he made mistakes in the answer key/rubric. He's just a disorganized professor and honestly, do yourself a favor and don't take him. Only reason he is 2 stars is because he can be funny in class.",1
"TL;DR - If you want to go into Data Science as a career, then you should take Max. Otherwise, stay far FAR away.

Pros:
- Everything he teaches is from a practical perspective. He frames the class and his lectures in a way that would actually help someone in the future if they wanted to go into data science. This is something that a lot of CS classes fail to do in high school and college, so finding a course that directly prepares you for a career in the subject area is rare. So as someone who wants to go into Data Sci / AI / ML, this class was incredibly helpful.
- He's a fun guy
- We got an A on pretty much all of the homework assignments

Cons: 
- The exams were really tough. He makes exams so that all of the questions are open ended and require critical thinking. Because of this, it's hard to figure out what to expect on an exam. He only gave us one practice exam for each of our exams, so there just wasn't that much material to prepare with. It felt like you either knew it or you didn't.
- The class and lectures are incredibly disorganized. We had at least 3 lectures where he showed up with an unfinished slideshow. He knows all of the material that he's gonna teach, he just sometimes shows up unprepared to lectures. The class is also disorganized as well. Many assignments were posted days or weeks after they should've been.
- None of the assignments had a clear rubric. We were given very little instruction on what we should actually be doing for some of assignments. This led to a lot of late night frustration as we just didn't know what the right answer for a given problem was supposed to be. This was because of how little specification was given for the assignments.",2
"Dude didn't grade any projects until the very last second, which counts for 46% of grade. Exam answers could be almost exactly the same, but with a 30% variance in grading because everything is free response. You can get a lot of points back through regrades though.",0
"Got to be one of the top 5 professors of all time. His lectures were very insightful not just academically, but also helped me understand how a lot of things work in big tech companies. The quiz was quite difficult because they were based on actual interview questions, which from a learning point of view is a huge plus. If you understand the concept and do your own exploration of the topics a bit beyond the slides, it becomes much more manageable. 

The lectures and the material are very organic and provide a fresh perspective. When I see that the MSDS program is industry focused, this is the sort of teaching style I expect.

He is also really funny and relatable.",4
"He said this would be nothing like his CMSC250 class, but honestly, it's just as bad. He's cool but he actually does not care about his job as much as I'd like him to. He would be a great friend and an amazing person to talk to but holy moly do not take a class with him. This is my FIRST EVER REVIEW. I'm studying for his second exam right now, and he just throws a bunch of topics at you, explains them halfway and tells you to have a deep understanding of them for the exam. If I didn't have ChatGPT to explain all of his concepts to me idk what I would do. His classes just feel silly, they feel like I'm wasting time and I'm not learning anything. Max can you please take your job a little more serious and stop ghosting students emails and actually prepare substantial slide shows please. I can't believe I'm even wasting my time writing a review right now instead of studying for this poop show of an exam to come on thursday, but that's just how his class got me feeling right now. (of course i'm still gonna get a b- or above)",1
"Laziest professor at the school, he can't be bothered to write an answer key for the practice exams, hes afk on piazza, and his TAs might be trolling on purpose.",0
"Extremely lazy, incompetent, and puts no effort into teaching or learning material.",0
"whyyyyyy just whyyyy??? this guy can't teach material, he makes mistakes in his slides and lectures, he is super lazy and disorganized and he gaslights his students into thinking that their regrade requests don't make any sense. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR TAKE IT WITH ANYONE ELSE!!!!! His slides, bad, his exams bad, class overall is bad.",0
"He's a pretty good lecturer if you can stay with him through a few mistakes and quirks here and there. Material is really not that hard and exam questions are tough but usually pretty straightforward. Also gives out extra credit for taking notes and asking good questions. Biggest gripe everyone has is that he and the class are very disorganized which I get but personally haven't experienced so I can't really speak on it. Also homeworks are graded for accuracy and make up 40% of your grade which can get annoying. Overall, you'll learn the material well and have a memorable professor who's relatively young and has experience in big tech.",3
"I found Max's class to be very entertaining as he is a fun lecturer who operates with a complete go with the flow structure. Considering 50% of our grade was from hw & discussion wkshts, the 4 exams with weights (12%,12%,12%,14%) did not create any ridiculous stress even if they are on the more difficult size. Where there is fault in Max's class is the lack of structure -- some better basis of this should be implemented without changing the core of the way Max teaches-- and the apparent miscommunication between prof Max and the TA's. Overall his rating I fear has been doxxed by very angry 320 students who did not understand his type of teaching before singing up and I would definitely recommend his 250 class if you despise the strictness/rigidness of Fawsi's class the way I did. Also yes technology is completely allowed in lecture and discussion, there are no surprise quizzes, and the discussions depending on the TA are helpful and usually manage to only last around 30 minutes which is great.",3
"Fantastic, he does a great job and has an easy enough course load. Projects are fun but the overall number of them is unpredictable but he’s great!",4
He’s amazing- best 320 prof available,4
"Professor Max is definitely an interesting professor. He has a unique teaching style and runs his class a bit differently than what you might be used to. He technically records lectures, but don’t count on seeing them—he rarely posts the recordings. He does eventually post his slides, but sometimes it's a bit delayed.

He’s very disorganized and can take quite a while to respond to emails, which can be frustrating. That said, he’s a genuinely nice guy and actually teaches really well during lecture when you’re there in person. If you’re willing to adapt to a less structured course and stay on top of things yourself, it’s manageable. Overall, not a terrible experience—just be prepared for a more unconventional approach.",2
I had him for 320 got an A. This dude is lowkey buns. Imagine a professor who wants to teach but is lazy ash. That's basically him. He's just a troll. Why did I have to have him again for 421.,0
"Conflates incompetence with ""challenging students."" Agree with his philosophy of not revealing exam answers, but when all students get are typo-ridden exams and brief, disorganized overview lectures on exam topics, it's egregiously obvious how little effort Max puts into writing assignments and exams. The responsibility of knowing course material falling solely on the student as detailed on the syllabus is unreasonable given that undergraduate students have not committed to becoming data science specialists, and near contemptible given Max's example.",0
"Terrible teacher plain and simple. He's lazy, slow, and unorganized. His homeworks are quite literally, look up shit and copy and paste the AI overview. I learned nothing from this course. Max is also quite an insufferable teacher, he pretends that his exams are difficult because they're are application based but in reality they're difficult because we've never learned how to apply anything. A couple times he'll introduce things and say we don't need to know it but you actually do. He'll introduce a million different concepts, barely scratch the surface of each topic, then expect you to know how to apply the concept like you were part of a large corporation and implementing a real-world model. Expect nothing to be graded until a month after the late deadline and tons of inconsistencies in the rubric. An answer on our first exam was incorrect (he admitting it was incorrect) and now at the end of the semester it still has not been fixed and some people still have unprocessed regrade requests. By far the worst professor I've had so far, I was maybe interested in half of one lecture. Some of the 5 star reviews are probably Max himself.",0
"Max is overall a challenging professor, but other than his exams, everything else is free. He told us on the last day of class that he automatically gives 100 on HWs as long as you tried, and that's 40% of the grade. I will admit that his exams are hard, but he drops unfair exam questions and curves if the grades are too low. His lecturing is pretty fast, but as long as you review his recaps and practice exams before, you can get a good enough understanding of the material to get an A in the class. Lowkey, the only reason I got a B- was because I bombed the second test since I had another exam and a research project I was working on. Other than that, it's manageable to get an A with him. I would recommend him since I got a very deep understanding of data science and machine learning from his class. We had a guest lecture from Fardina, and it was worse than any of Max's lectures. She went over BFS, DFS, and things we already knew, and I had to learn everything from scratch from Max's slides. Definitely take Max over Fardina if you want to learn something from 320. Otherwise, take Fardina for the free A.",4
"Max is very unorganized, but still tries to make the class interesting and actually manages to do so in my opinion. The other parts of the course tho, are really REALLY bad. I have never had any problems in math academically, and this is the first class I got a 50% grade on a midterm. The scaling of the exams is actually so bad, and while the 2nd midterm was fine, the third midterm was out of 30 points, and each question would be like 2 points to 4 points. But if you commit a minor small mistake, they will deduct half the points. I forgot to multiply one number in the denominator of a question, and I got a 1/4 for that, which deducted 10% of my grade on the midterm. The TA's are actually the worst ones I've ever seen, the discussions are mandatory but not like you learn anything in those worksheets either. The TAs don't answer piazza questions, don't grade properly, take a lot of time, and don't do anything properly. One of the answers I got was ""it is antisymetric for values 1 and 0"" and they deducted my whole grade for that because I didnt specify ""It is not antisymmetric for the rest of the values"". It is honestly such a frustrating class, with the TAs making it worse than it already is. Max also wants his exams to be harder than normal, tries to throw curveballs, and if you don't know how to fully do a question, forget getting partial credit for it.",0
"Max is goated idc what the other reviews say. He's probably the most engaging CS lecturer I've had at UMD. He doesn't bog you down with basically any math, you just need to know the general concepts and how to apply them in a real project. He's still very disorganized, and his exams are obviously very polarizing, but I feel like I actually learned a lot from this class. Despite his slides being in a constant state of chaos, he's very good at explaining difficult concepts and tying them to interesting real world examples. His AI ethics lecture in particular was genuinely fantastic.

All the HWs are super easy to get full credit on, and imo his exams are not bad at all. If you listen to him in lecture and retain his main points, then an hours worth of study before the exam is all you need. To be clear, for any class other than CMSC320, take somebody else. I cannot imagine having him for a class as rigorous as 250 or 351. But if you want to learn how to do data science and machine learning in the real world, take Max.",4
"Literal goat. everything is super disorganized but he is the funniest and most engaging professor I've ever had. my only quarrel with him is that everything takes ages to be graded, and the study material that he gives us isn't that comprehensive.",2
"Absolutely horrendous wording on exams, refuses to correct or even admit it, has an extremely loose grasp on the english language",0
"His style is unorthodox and now how the class should be taught. Many of the concepts are taught at a very surface level and you have to fill in the gaps. Organization is horrible, but you for sure learn more than other professors as you need to learn the skills, class covers wide array of useful topics in data science. 

Homework is  easy and class exams are harder as they are conceptual and little practice is given.",1
"Super disorganized and lectures don't go anywhere near the kind of depth you would expect from a 400 level class, it was a struggle to learn anything at all",1
this man wants you succeed. he's so nice and will work with you. you can get extra credit for submitting class notes. two downsides is that he doesn't check his emails and he can be a little all over the place.,3
Had a traumatic semester with him last year. Don't take him. All the good reviews here are definitely him writing them.,0
"He is just a guy that someone ended up as a professor. He is very chill and approachable and pretty funny. His organization has definitely improved comparing to the previous reviews. Exams usually have ONE weird question, but the rest are basically reused from lecture examples. The final exam was just a concoction of reused midterm questions, lecture examples and weird questions that felt like he found on youtube. 

Pros: 
- Good grade distribution w/ 50% hw and completion discussion worksheets
- Down to earth funny guy that cares alot about his students
- Gives loads of extra credits
- You can contest almost everything (midterms deductions) by storming his office.
- Easy material so his chaotic and unorthodox style works well

Cons:
- Several exam questions per exam test materials at a higher order than lecture level
- Questionable TA that are consistently late for exam and silent on piazza
- Takes a long time to grade things",4
"Max is genuinely a very disorganized professor, his lectures at the beginning of the semester started off with lots of mistakes, errors, and he tends to go through material a lot quicker than necessary. Closer to the middle of semester he started getting better for lectures but it always felt like he came in unprepared for what he was going to teach and as if he didn't even review the slideshow he would be putting on the screen. 

Additionally there was a huge lack of timely completion for our homeworks and exams and it constantly felt like we were guessing what our grade in the class was. Piazza responses from the instructors were also so limited and it felt like the TAs also had no idea what was going on. Most of them barely responded to questions in Piazza.

Grading: 

Pros: 
- very good weight distribution where 50% of the grade from discussion worksheets and homework
- 3 exams and a final was nice because each exam was less weight (12%, 12%, 12%, 14%)
- Extra credit (.05%) for things such as piazza posts, every 3 lecture notes and in class practices 

Cons: 
- exams were all over the place, with the first two exam averages being in the 70's range
- first exam had a question that Max wasn't even able to fully solve in lecture 
- homework grading was much harsher than expected considering in lecture Max would often skip steps that the homeworks expected us to provide",1
"Simply put, Max is a data scientist, not a professor, though students call him that (he's an instructor). This might be why he doesn't organize or structure the class like a traditional college course. He says himself, the real world is messy, and maybe he's trying to give us a taste of that by ""accidentally"" forgetting slides, putting wrong links on recaps, or misstating final exam times, among other small things. The disorganization was pretty high. It makes you wonder if this is intentional or if he's just forgetful, like when he leaves comments on old slides to fix them but then just patches them up on the fly in lecture.

This extends to the TAs. He delegates all grading to them, so exams don't get graded until the last few weeks, maybe even the week of finals, which is no excuse. I didn't really go to office hours, so maybe they're more active or helpful there. But from what I saw on Piazza and heard in the group chat, the TAs weren't generally all that helpful, with mostly just one person, usually the Head TA, doing all the visible work like answering questions. Other TAs might cancel office hours frequently (like one TA did 13 out of 15 weeks).

Regarding the course material itself, the slides are often intentionally barebones, meant to supplement him speaking. The readings are long online articles, mostly for exposure and getting into a data science headspace; they don't come up much on exams but are fair game, maybe for a question like ""design an experiment"" or ""name 3 considerations."" You often don't need the specific reading to answer, but they can help.

The assignments, called ""homework"" but really more like projects, are where this course gets good, especially if you're into data science/ML. He'll give you a single page with minimal directions and some data, and you have to find something interesting, use ML evaluation, make slides with not too much content, and create polished visuals. I think CS needs more of these realistic projects that force you to look stuff up.

The most learning by far comes from these open-ended assignments and the exams. The exams are the most open-ended I've taken in CS. They're not multiple choice, no algorithm tracing, no complex math, just open-ended questions that force critical thinking. You will need to know Python, specifically Pandas. Documentation might be provided, but you need to understand what to use, which you learn from the homework. You'll learn a lot if you spend time on the homework and study for the open-endedness of the exams.",2
"Max is a decent professor. His lectures were mainly discussing content and then doing lots of practice problems. Discrete math can be somewhat hard to teach as sometimes as a student you just have to get it. So honestly, he did a pretty good job at teaching content. My main complaint was the lack of consistency with grading and feedback from the TA's. The head TA Josh was very good, however. So ultimately, Max is a good professor. Just be prepared for some bumps in the road, but in the end, it'll all work out.",3
"So this is my second semester in a row taking Max, after I had him last semester too in CMSC320. Meaning, I am pretty confident in all of the things that follow. 

Just trust me—don't take him if you don't have to. He is very disorganized, has terrible exam questions, decent projects, awful slides and lectures, bad TAs. At least he is a nice guy.",1
"Overall one of the easier CS classes that I've taken. 5 homeworks, 3 exams, and 1 final. There's so much extra credit from the homeworks and other things that as long as you try, you can have over a 100% with just those. This gives a very good padding for the exams. The exams are more about conceptual knowledge and critical thinking, he wants you to learn how to think like a scientist. But he's pretty disorganized, unresponsive, and slow with grading.",2
"Not a bad professor overall. Biggest con is that his lectures tend to be very disorganized. Other than that, his exams are fair and his grade breakdown is reasonable (40% homework, 10% discussion, 50% exams). His exams also contain more or less what he covers in lecture, so as long as you look at his notes or go to lecture you will be fine for the exams (the first exam did have a question that he didn't cover in class, but he later went back and curved it). Final was just a bunch of old problems that people didn't do well on in past midterms, which was a grade boost. One thing to note is that if you really do care about learning discrete math, I wouldn't take Max. His proofs are disorganized and lack structure, so if you'd like to learn how to write formal proofs I would stay away.",3
"Max is one of those younger instructors that curses during class so people know hes chill. 

- Did you think the exams or other major assignments were fair?
This class had some good homeworks. They are pretty open-ended and feel like something you might actually do in the real world. I felt like I learned a lot from them. Exams, on the other hand, were kind of annoying. They were not difficult, but max tries to be different and ask questions that ask you to apply your knowledge instead of just memorizing stuff. I think that is actually a pretty noble goal, but in practice, a lot of the one-part questions are memorization anyways, and the longer questions are often poorly worded and kind of confusing. Overall I think he tries too hard to make be different from the other instructors. He also gives a lot of extra credit opportunities.

- Did you think the professor had reasonable expectations of the students in the course overall?
Yea

- Were you a fan of the professor's teaching style?
Max is pretty disorganized. A lot of the time he will leave notes for himself in his slides, forget about them, and fix them on the fly during lecture. There was also an approximately two week stretch where he gave the 75 minute class 50 minute lectures. He's a pretty good speaker, but I didn't really pay attention and still did fine. Lecture recordings weren't posted, you had to email him if you missed a class for the lecture for some reason. He got tired of this in the middle of the semester and posted them though. The due dates for assignments were also all jacked up and always needed clarification on piazza. Also Exam #3 was on the last day of class???? It was more difficult than the other ones and was literally a week before the final, which I thought was stupid.

- Was the workload appropriate for the number of credits?
Yes

- Was this course a waste of time or was it beneficial in some way?
The homework projects were very good.

- How much support were you given throughout the semester (office hours, extra resources, etc.)?
He is a pretty hands-off professor. Piazza presence could be higher. He kind of expects you to figure a lot of stuff out, but it is totally manageable.

Overall, class is pretty easy.",2
"He is actually not as bad as the reviews seem.

He is is a nice professor and tries to make the class interesting through EC participation and through jokes.

I would say to start the homeworks early, go to office hours if needed and prep ahead of times for the exams.

I got a 68% on the 2nd exam but did well on everything else and managed to get an A. 

He is nice but the class is very disorganized and the Piazza response times are poor.",3
"disorganized but!!!
he is humble enough to admit to when he is wrong and he works with you to succeed, and he's super chill and so kind",3
"There’s no transparency about grading at all, he just put in final grades without even mentioning what the cutoffs would be, without adding in all the extra credit and without even telling us that they would be imported into testudo. This is just one example of the lack of transparency and the lateness of grading in this class.",0
"Maksym seems to be a very chill, albeit lazy, professor. The workload in his class is quite small, and he has a GOATED grading system with 40% homework, 10% discussions, and 50% exams. Do well on the hmws so that even if you mess up on the exams, your grade isn't going to sink like the Titanic",2
Bro's gotta work on his organization,1
"Took him for both 320 and 421, classes are easy because of homework weight but he is the laziest professor in the school",0
"I swear hes not that bad, would give 3.5 but rounding up to 4 seems fair

Pros:
EXCELLENT LECTURER (besides having bad slides) I learned so much from them
Didn't dive into the inner workings of the ML stuff which I appreciated, really focused on what you would use in the real world
Projects were interesting and pretty easily graded
Class itself is hard but its not hard to get a good grade
I liked the exams! instead of just cramming information for me to forget 2 hours after, I felt like I had to really understand the material to answer the questions

Cons:
Disorganized yes, this will be annoying
Exams are all over the place and vague
Sometimes would let us out of class early because he didn't plan lectures out well? This was annoying and felt like a waste of time

At the end of the day, hes a good lecturer who you will learn a lot from and its relatively easy to get a good grade. I really don't know what much else you can ask for, if you wanted to be spoonfed an A maybe take someone else but if you actually wanted to learn about DS/ML take Max",3
"He's not bad, his lectures are sometimes interesting or hella boring. Some reviews say he's arrogant and condescending, but I didn't feel that. He's just so lazy. 

On the first day of class, his syllabus on the homepage added up to 97%. Then he had a slideshow where two back-to-back slides had 2 different syllabi, one adding up to over 100% and one to 100%.

His homework is put together lazily, the instructions are minimal, and there are mistakes like a link saying ""SQL"" leading to Pandas and a ""Pandas"" link leading to ""SQL"". 

He is not active on Piazza, and neither are his TAs, except for every week to announce that he's throwing up and office hours are cancelled. 

The first two exams weren't hard and the third one was hard. The harder the exam, the higher the grade, because any BS answer is marked as correct. Also, Exam 3 was not graded before the final. The final was not bad either, I struggled on the coding parts though, since they were a little tricky. The practice exams are kind of useless, like we were only given answers to half of the practice exams, and the answers are useless. I question like ""name 3..."" has the answer of ""any 3 is fine"", and some of the answers are like ""take points off if they did xyz"" instead of answering.

The homework is kinda fun, sort of. You get hella extra credit, so all the averages were above 100,% and there is hella extra credit outside of the homework. This class is literally just a free A.",1
"He'll lure you in with a 40% homework grade (it's graded harshly), a 10% discussion grade(only free part of the course), and low weighted midterms and finals. The midterms were really bad, especially the first one. He never makes clear what's going on in the course. Nobody knew what the cutoffs for an A, A-, B+, ect were. Extra credit is almost worthless (0.05% per). He was extremely disorganized for all his lectures, he was late for 2 or maybe all 3 midterms so we lost valuable time (compensated with 0.5 extra credit points on a 32 point midterm). 

That being said. He's a chill guy and explained concepts in a really fun way. I liked his laid back approach focusing on more of the conceptual aspect as opposed to something more stingy on format (like Fawzi). If it weren't for the above issues he'd get 4 stars.",1
"40% hw grade + 10% discussion grade so u essentially cannot fail, and pretty good lecturer when hes not realizing that his slides are completely wrong lmao.
idk if this is good or bad but u can get by comfortably with almost never studying",2
"i literally loved his class, but thats coming from someone who just loves riddles tbh, because i know our final hurt hella people who didnt know what was happening since everything was so vague

also he does not curve or drop at ALL so expect your grade to be your grade

imma be honest i took a makeup once and our TA didnt even show up til 1.5hours later which was kinda annoying but honestly its very passable",4
"CMSC250 is meant to be your introduction to proofs and mathematical rigor in Computer Science and I did not get that at all from this class. Lecture was relatively easy to follow and he was an engaging lecturer. However, he hand-waved a lot of things that I felt shouldn't have been handwaved. For example, we never really did structural induction like Fawzi's class did, instead he just kind of gave an outline of what it would look like. He is also a bit disorganized and him and his TAs were all five minutes late to one of our exams. There was a proof on our first exam that was unlike anything we had done up to that point which was rather annoying. Overall his class was fine, but I would recommend taking a different professor for 250 if Maksym is one of the options. His class may be easier to get a higher grade in, but it will come back to bite you when you have to write proofs for other classes in the future.",2
Super disorganized. Lectures are interesting but he forgets to plan them in advance. The actual material is very easy and you should be fine on exams (he tends to retroactively add a curve) and projects if you review slides or show up to class.,1
"CMSC320 with Max

Lectures are interesting to begin with, and Max makes them entertaining as well. Couldn't have asked for a better early morning lecture (9:30 AM). 

Exams are on the harder side, but fair. He said once that if he could, he would replace exams with a one-on-one conversation with him just talking about the material (but obviously infeasible). The exams he gives attempt to replicate this vibe. 

Projects/Homeworks are really open ended, and honestly fun, (nothing like the highly specific, constraint ridden, edge-case-hell classes like 216 and 330). You are given data, and basically a single page of instruction of what he wants you to report on. You're free to be as extra, creative, or barebones as you want (being extra and creative often gets extra credit)

Overall a great change of pace from the rest of the CS meatgrinder classes and highly recommend",4
Max when I catch you!!! Do not take this class with him I'm begging you. He is the most unserious professor I have come across. And yeah he's funny... i guess! But really and truly just take another professor it will save you the headache. A hard class like this you need a serious professor and max is not it I fear...,0
"Entertaining lecture, but a very disorganized lecture pacing. He assigned 7 of 3blue1brown's videos to look over instead of teaching such content himself. It doesn't seem to be optional videos either; it's the actual content that he will put on the exams. It felt very unprofessional. I would have learn a lot more if I had not gone to his class and spent the time studying on my own or with another professor. There is, however, alot of extra credit in class. You can take notes, group study photo, and submit it to Gradescope for extra credit. You could also put in more work on your homework to give extra credit. 

However, I would not take this class if your goal is to have a good start on the fundamentals of data science. As some of the comments said, he is an unserious professor; he is funny, but to learn, we would need to be more organized. I recommend only taking him if you already have prior machine learning, data science concepts and are here for a laugh.",0
"This man confuses me. Everything people say about him is true and false at the same time. Even after getting to know the guy, he's still an enigma. 

Forewarning: DO NOT take this class at 9:30. You will fall into any of three categories if you do:
People who simply do not show up.
People who are consistently late and only get half of the information since the slides don't make up for the lecture.
Nerds. 
Lectures are entertaining enough, but Max knows that machine learning gets boring after a while. To solve this, he implements a no phone policy and instead keeps your attention with wacky stories about his work life (which are honestly pretty funny). However, most of the stuff seems to go one-ear-and-out-the-other for students (including me). Sometimes Max does do coding in lecture which, while being a nice break from the data science presentation slog, doesn't really help since he doesn't post any code he wrote.

I wish I could tell you what to do to study for exams and what to prepare for, but I cannot. Exams change at random between semesters, meaning you can have study material from someone from last semester's class and it wouldn't be any good. He always says to do the readings, and you should, but you cannot tell when they're important or not; some exams quite literally have 50% of the questions be reading-related questions (in which some were just trivia from the readings), while some exams will not have a single reading question on it. Regrades are pretty much a waste of time unless the TAs made a very obvious grading mistake. Minor grading mistakes will be justified with some hamfisted reason about how ""you should've known this even though the question is marked open-ended"" or ""you had the right answer but added this phrase which I don't think it's correct"", but I'm not sure whether that was Max or the arguably worse power-tripper TAs that handled the regrades. 

Homeworks are hard but graded leniently (as in points will be taken off for minor things but only 5 out of 100 points) to where the average is very high. Homeworks do get harder each semester though, so watch out for that.

In my opinion, you only want to take this course IF you have a light schedule. Don't take it concurrently with 351 and 330, and don't take it if you're doing other hard classes in the same semester. You will not want to spend time studying for this course, but you will have to, so make sure you have a clear schedule to do so.",1
"Nelson is a great guy! His personality is so nice and he's HILARIOUS in class. He makes it fun to learn and a lot easier to pay attention in class. I am a newbie to computer science so the class itself was a little difficult. Nelson is a good guy for people new to computer science because he will make your introduction to compsci very fun. 
The first midterm for us was really easy and was just like the practice study guide they gave us. The second midterm was ridiculously difficult. It was impossible for anyone with no experience prior to have done well on that exam. Even people that were experienced were depressed after the exam. As for the final, it was a lot better. It wasn't too difficult like the first one but it was still challenging. Make sure to study a lot and go to all the discussions and lectures and to try to learn on your own time because class time is not enough. This class is tailored more for the experienced kids so being a newbie is quite the disadvantage. The whole ""you don't need any experience prior"" was one of the biggest lies I was told. Also be aware of cheating and copying other people's projects or even collaborating. There was a whole thing this year where the professors are going to prosecute those who cheated on projects which will result in an XF (failure and cheating mark) that will stay with you forever even if you retake the class. It's also better to do it on your own because you learn a lot more that way. 
BTW: TA hours are a HUGE mess. It's always packed in the TA office and you have to wait a long time for the TA to even come to you to help you. Kinda why I don't understand why the rules for even talking about the projects together are so strict, but can't really do anything about it. Don't show anyone your code and don't ask anyone for theirs. It's a serious issue.
TIP: Do really well on the projects because those were the only things holding my grade up (as well as the quizzes). You can bomb the exams and still get a decent grade if you do extremely well on quizzes and projects. ",3
"Nelson is absolutely and unequivocally the worst instructor I have ever had the misfortune of taking a class with. He is decent at lecturing most of the time, but that is not too much of a merit, since he just reads off slides. I have asked questions both in class, and in office hours, and I have never received a satisfactory answer. For example, one time in class, he offered an opportunity for us to ask questions about the current project we were working on. When I asked a question, he told me my question was too complicated to understand, and instead of letting me clarify, he instead told me that he wouldn't answer my question, and would be moving on to the next topic. I decided to go to his office hours to try and clarify my question. However, he would not even let me finish my question before interrupting, and repeatedly telling me my confusion regarding the project was because I had not read the public tests (which is a solution not remotely related to my original question). He was very rude and discourteous the entire time I was in his office.

He uses Piazza (sort of like a forum), under the pretense of having TAs or fellow students being able to help answer questions regarding the class. However, he only uses Piazza as a way to avoid answering nuanced questions himself. This was quite obvious the other times I had attended his office hours, when he would simply tell me to ask my question to the TAs instead.

As noted in other reviews, he stops lecture to call out students unnecessarily for the most ridiculous things. Aside from it not being funny, it is quite embarrassing to be put on the spot like that.

He is able to still be popular among students because he makes frequent jokes all throughout class. While some of them can be funny, a lot of the jokes I find to be annoying. He jokes about marijuana, cocaine, drinking, etc., in order to project a ""chill"" image which the typical college student will find hysterical.

To summarize this review, Nelson has repeatedly proven he is rude, unable to answer questions that are nuanced, and desperate to be liked. Those genuinely are the three most dangerous traits an instructor can have, as he will find opportunities to belittle you throughout the semester if he knows you don't like him. Stay away from his class at all costs.",0
"People told me Nelson was awesome before I chose his class, but honestly I'm a little disappointed now. He jokes a lot during the lecture, with makes the class seems easy, but I just feel like I cannot really learn from him. Also I don't like him making fun of students in the lecture. 

I think his exams and quizzes are fair, but the projects are really hard. I personally won't recommend him. In my opinion, he might be a good guy but just an okay professor.",2
"Nelson is a wonderfully funny professor who really values his students. I would certainly recommend that you take him, if possible, because he makes his classes very enjoyable. His exams can be fairly tricky, but if you study well you will be fine.",4
"In my opinion, Nelson is a solid CS professor. I took 216 with him, and he made it a point to ensure us that it wasn't a weeder course. 

Once you get around the accent, he's great at explaining the topics at hand. He keeps his lectures fairly lighthearted and relaxed, and he also has a sense of humor. He, along with his TAs, are stationed on Piazza to help students with any problems or concerns, and this is very convenient and helpful. 

Projects take longer to complete than those in 131 and 132, and starting early is essential. Quizzes and Exams are fair, and he provides a test bank from previous semesters. The final was challenging, so be prepared. 

Regarding the cons of a class with Nelson - he can be very annoying. The amount of times he will stop the lecture just to call out a student fooling around is just unnecessary and it also distracts everyone in the class. His humor also doesn't appeal to everyone. In addition, be prepared for your inbox to be flooded with his email updates on the course material. I once remember receiving six emails in a 15 minute span from him alone.

Overall, he's a great CS prof, and the only professor I would take over him is Fawzi Emad.  ",3
"Here's the thing with Nelson: he's a great guy and fun to be around, but sometimes that gets in the way of his teaching. He jokes a lot, which makes lecture interesting, but I feel as if I could've gotten a lot more out of 216 with someone else. His projects and quizzes are fair. The tests are fair too, although he likes to test very nit-picky, minor details that any normal person would just test out in a dummy program rather than memorize.",2
"I think he is an amazing professor. He is a pretty decent lecturer, but I think what makes him stand out is how receptive he is to student concerns. Every decision he makes is meant to help us succeed and have a better understanding of the material.",4
"He's a pretty good professor.

His lectures are extremely boring and he sticks unfunny jokes in them, but all of the slides and recordings of his lectures were available online. I needed to start my projects right away because the last half of them were given back-to-back with little time to work on them and I couldn't get any help from TAs. If enough students were confused about some part of an assignment, he would explain it in detail during lectures, but individualized assistance was hard to find. He never gave any of the pop quizzes he threatened to give, but if he says that something will be on a test or quiz, it will be.",3
"Nelson's class was very disappointing.  The first half was challenging and interesting.  The second half died for me.  The projects were super simplistic but overly complicated with external obfuscation/unclear specification.  He seemed to claim this was some kind of test of character or professional challenge.  But it just made the last 1/3 of the course into a technically inadequate, stressful game.

He is funny but that's not why I'm in school.  Nor am I in school to be stressed and have my character tested.  There were way too many cheaters, collaborators and brown-nosers who had their strategies for getting their projects done, and they really benefitted in the second half of the course during the b.s. projects.  The students who were doing their own work were then at a disadvantage.  Meanwhile the technical quality of the material covered during that last 1/3 was very low.

i'd rather have a less engaging, entertaining teacher and get a good education throughout the entire class.",2
"I've taken Nelson for CMSC216/CMSC330, and he has to be one of my favorite CS professors. He explains the material well and tries to keep it fun in the process. If you are deciding between Nelson and another professor for a CMSC class - do yourself a favor and take Nelson. You will learn a bunch and have fun in the process. ",4
"Great professor , absolutely hilarious. Very fair in terms of exams , quizzes , and projects. You can find everything in his lectureExamples if you are confused on any topic. Would highly recommend, best teacher i've so far in CS.",4
"Great professor, awesome person.

If computer science is not your thing, this is the best professor you can have. He explains every concept thoroughly and tests you only on what he goes over in class. I'd highly recommend going to class because if you don't, the powerpoint slides will seem really disjointed and incoherent, but in class he explains everything.
Projects are extremely reasonable and are very relevant to what you're doing in class. Quizzes mimic the worksheets he gives out. If you have a problem in the class, USE YOUR RESOURCES (professor, TAs) because they can immensely help.
Makes some funny jokes that lighten the mood of his class, creating a very comfortable environment.

The only complaint is that the end of the semester is pretty rushed in terms of material. He goes over many design patterns, sorting techniques, and algorithm strategies very quickly, and you're expected to have a basic understanding of ALL of them on the final exam. ",4
"I thought Nelson was a really nice guy, but his lectures weren't really all that good.  He makes the class easy tho, so if all you're worried about is your grade, you'll be fine.  I recommend taking another instructor (Fawzi Emad or Evan Golub) if you really want to learn something.",1
"In all honesty, I don't know why everyone is praising Nelson. Maybe it is because they didn't have him for CMSC122. Seriously, don't take this class. It is just a bunch of unneeded stress. 

Nelson is the first teacher that I've ever had that actually discouraged asking questions. I asked him reasonable questions during lecture and he not only didn't answer them, he makes an example of me in front of the class. 

He also teaches the class as if it is a bunch of grad students or something. He goes super fast and will once in a while ask us if he is going to fast. When I told him he was, he proceeded to go at the same pace.

He is also very inaccessible. He often ignores emails or sends back nasty messages saying things that frankly, I don't understand. The TA's also don't show up to class so when you go into office hours (which also suck) you don't know who they are. 

I went to a lot of the lectures, but I found myself learning more from a friend in a 2 hour period than I did all year with him.

I noticed that computer science is a thing that comes natural to some and not to others. If you are like me and know nothing, seriously reconsider taking this class. ",0
"He's a good professor and will take every single question you have. His jokes are hilarious the first few days, but then he starts to recycle and it gets old and awkward fast. Which is fine because he really does break down the material into manageable pieces for someone like me who has never done a bit of programming in my life.

There are quizzes but he tells you when they are. He threatens pop-quizzes sometimes because a few weeks in no one listens to him anymore because he moves on to miscellaneous and useless topics after JavaScript, but he never pulled it. 

Make sure to ask him questions in class though because once that clock strikes 1:50 (or whenever the class ends), he is outta there. Won't answer your questions and isn't helpful in office hours. Go to the TA's for that, and that's what he tells you. 

I'm taking this as a programming requirement for my math major so if you need one and want to do minimal work, take this course with Nelson.",2
"I took CMSC132 during the summer and I say he's not a bad professor. Lecture material was kind of boring to me as a lot I already knew, but Nelson tried to connect it to real life examples.

The two things I didn't like were that he would make jokes time to time and he would pay too much attention to me. I got 100% on his pop quiz, so I was actually paying attention. I understand why he makes jokes, but I didn't come to class to listen to jokes. I came to learn about OOP. So whenever he did that, I would study something else.",3
"Nelson was funny, but eventually it got really annoying, and was a waste of time. For a DCC class, this class was a lot of work, considering that most of us don't have programming experience. He's nice and helpful though, so if you enjoy a joker and comedian, Nelson might be the professor for you.",2
"This is by far the worst class at any level of education I have ever taken in my life. The syllabus did not describe the guidelines in the class at all. It just listed that there would be projects at some time during the semester but students were not informed of when projects were due until they were assigned. The professor also assigned a major assignment each week about halfway through the semester. I never had a break from this class. I was always either working on a project or studying for a test or quiz. I understand that there will be assignments, but I never had more work in any class of college so far and I have taken some 400-level classes.

When I had questions about some of the assignments, I would go to both the professor and the TA's office hours. However, once I was there, I received no help. I was told to look over the powerpoint slides again and then turned away. My questions were not answered at all.

The lectures for this class were incredibly boring. The teaching style was horrible. At the beginning of the semester, Nelson said he did not care what students did during his class. Yet throughout the semester, he constantly called out students for talking, texting or typing on their computer. His lecture style was not engaging at all. It was so hard to focus and he did not gear the information at all to people who are not great with computers like myself. Whenever students asked questions, his answers were not helpful at all. 

Worst class ever. Do not take this if you are not great with computers and are not a computer science major.",0
"Nelson is a very engaging and fun teacher to have. He enjoys to teach and make jokes at the same time which is very entertaining. Even though he said in the beginning that he will teach like you never did programming before, I believe that is not true. Exams are not that difficult and projects are pretty fair, where as if the class is struggling to finish it, he will extend the deadline. Overall, I would recommend him as a teacher 100%. The TA does not explain the concepts pretty well. ",4
"I had Nelson for the first time in a winter course on PHP (cmsc389p). I loved the class. I highly recommend it. Some of the reviews here complained about Nelson's teaching in class, but the problems with these critics are that Nelson teaches such easy topics (CMSC131, CMSC132, CMSC122 for non majors, CMSC198 for non majors), and other ridiculously easy classes that he doesn't have to spend all of class lecturing ""int x = 3;"" and basic syntax to you. He's funny, approachable, and will be a great teacher as long as (in his words) ""they pay me enough"". Great guy. Sign up quick, because his classes tend to fill up.",4
"The first day he had me laughing so hard, i knew it was going to be a good semester. Hes really great at explaining tough concepts, extremely helpful if you go to his office hours, very patient with students who do not understand the material, and very funny. Its rare to have a teacher that can make the class laugh every single lecture. Awesome professor.",4
"Great teacher.  He is very straightforward and posts all the powerpoints used in lecture online.  There are also weekly study sheets on the class website that I found helpful for our quizzes and tests.  Nelson also cares about his students, and he is very good at communicating via e-mail and addressing student concerns.  He's also a pretty funny guy, and will tell jokes to make class more interesting.  Just pay attention, because if he sees you using your phone or going on facebook he will call you out on it in front of the whole class!",4
"Nelson is an excellent teacher for thsi class if you have programmed before.  Otherwise, the pace of the class might be rather brisk.  Sometimes he does not explain certain material, and asks you to go to his office hours, which apparently he doesn't give a shit about. On the bright side, he is an extremely funny guy, but he has his days, like some days he is 100% business, and other days he is just cracking jokes and you don't learn shit.  He is very understanding in projects, and will give you extra time if you truly need it.  Overall, an extremely friendly guy, but if you get sidetracked, he will pick on you in front of everybody.

My opinion? Take this dude, for whatever class he teaches.",3
Guy says he teaches the class as if none of the students have had programming experience before but that's so false ....... guy sits there and writes code and just gives little explanation. Majority of the class already had programming experience so they understood so the class was clearly catered toward them.  Get Fawzi.,0
"Nelson is a great teacher. He's very upbeat and likes to tell lots of really geeky jokes during class. He'll know if you're not paying attention and he'll call you out on it, but it's not a big deal. The class is certainly not an easy one. Make sure you have plenty of time to do the projects. Nelson is very accessible and always there to help.",3
"Funny teacher whose ppt lectures are relatively more interesting. Just do not expect him to help you with any personal programming issues. Easy A. Point questions toward TA. Sometimes does not show up to classes for unknown reasons. Does not do anything he doesn't get paid for, I guess. If you have questions just be sure to ask during class so that he will actually give you an answer.",3
"Pretty easy class. Projects could get a bit tricky, but tests and quizzes were not a problem at all. Starting the projects early and getting them out of the way is a good idea.

Nelson was encouraging and helpful the few times I have approached him outside of class. As a teacher, he did a pretty good job explaining concepts. No complaints here.",4
"Terrible professor. If you have a backround in programming you will be fine. But if you are taking the class because you are forced to take a programming class and are not a CMSC major and do not spead time programming ""just for fun"" you will be lost. And he is not helpful. Most of my conversations with him were as follows; I dont understand this....
Well, we went over that in class.
Yes I remember, but I didnt understand it in class either. And I still dont understand it.
Well why dont you understand it? I went over it in class.
I know, but I dont understand it.
OVER AND OVER AND OVER",0
"I took CMSC198J over winter term with Nelson and absolutely loved it! He explained concepts very well and gave us a lot of time to practice programming while he was around to help us. This class was an excellent way to finish my Comp-Sci requirement, and the winter term set-up gave us a lot of face time with Nelson. He was very funny and very helpful and appreciated any student who actually made an effort to do the practice programming challenges. Some of the projects took a lot of time, but I found them fun--like solving a puzzle. 
Nelson was an awesome professor and also wrote me a great review for study abroad. If you are a motivated student with a sense of humor, I highly recommend his class. ",4
"He likes to joke around a lot in class and its pretty funny at first but really gets old and annoying after about the first week. When asked a question in class, he'll most likely respond ""come to my office hours"" or ""go to the TA office hours"". Then when you go to his office hours, he gets irritated and tells you that he already went over it in class. He always emphasizes the fact that he cares about his students and wants to see them successful in class. I really question that...

Best advice I can give you for this class is to start the homeworks and projects early and do take advantage of the TA office hours. They help out a lot. Also he posts practice quizzes and exams which are pretty good study material for the real thing. 

Oh yea, and never go to his office hours asking about a project that is due soon. I went to ask a question about a project three days prior to the due date about a question the TA's couldn't even answer. He spent 10 minutes lecturing me about how ""successful programmers"" start projects early so that they aren't cramming to do it at the end. Then he told me to go to TA office hours...

Overall not a hard class but don't expect too much out of Nelson. ",1
"the only reason im giving nelson any stars at all is because he explains concepts pretty well during class. other than that, if you have to take 132 this semester, take it with fawzi. nelson wastes A LOT of time saying jokes that have NOTHING to do with class. he may seem funny at first, but when you really need help and he doesn't answer your question, it's not funny anymore. when people ask him questions, he either says ""ask the TA"", ""we already went over that"", or ""come to my office hours"". ive gone to his office hours and he just sends me back to the TAs. he also is not considerate of our time. he gave a project AND homework at the same time (homeworks are like mini projects). i also agree with the person below me about EVERYTHING they mentioned.",1
"i lot of people liked him. but to me he was very annoying and got on my nerves.  he tries too hard to be funny, and most of the time isn't funny at all.  he also says he does not care if u don't pay attention in class as long as you don't disrupt the class.  but he himself disrupts the class every 5 min to yell/joke at some kid for not paying attention when the student wasn't even disrupting the class",1
"This is probably the hardest I have ever worked for an ""elective"" course, but I really did enjoy the class. It says it is for beginners but Nelson covers a lot of difficult material. I had background in some web programming so I did alright, but the people without any experience seemed to struggle. I would take it over again just for him, he's worth coming to class! If nothing else, even if I was so behind I wanted to cry, Nelson made class interesting and fun.",4
"Awesome guy. I've had better teachers, but Nelson keeps class interesting with his jokes, and the way he ran his class really helped me to get a solid grip on the material.",4
"I took him a few years back, he is pretty good at teaching, but goes overboard with the jokes every now and then to a point where you feel kind of embarrassed and annoyed. Some days he is on the money with his comedy show, but some days I really felt like telling him to stfu.

The only other complaint was that he rushed the end of the semester pretty hard, so make sure you stay on top of the material. During the last week he made us memorize details for dozens of design patterns which were all on the final.",3
"Quite simply, Nelson is among the best professors UMD has to offer. His class is immensely interesting, he is very funny, and he is a fair grader. The work isn't very hard, but if it is, he is very helpful. No complaints.",4
"I actually took class with Nelson in Fall 2006, but felt that he was such a good teacher he deserved a review now that this site is up. Nelson is an excellent teacher that keeps his students laughing, which keeps the material interesting. Take every class he teaches!",4
Nelson is a good teacher. Like everyone has said he tells jokes during class to keep the boring subject material interesting. He also does a good job explaining the projects. I got an A in his class.,3
"I took 132 with Nelson a few semesters ago, but I did want to mention that he is a great teacher. He keeps class interesting, always cracking jokes and telling stories. My only complaint is that sometimes I was in the mood to just learn what I needed to and leave, and sometimes the jokes were a little too much. Other than that, I learned a lot and had a bit of fun, too. Got an A in his class.",3
"Nelson is one of the best professors I have had at Maryland.  He always keeps his lectures interesting with jokes and stories.  He also is great at teaching the material so it's easy to understand.  His projects take some time, but he gives a great explanation of exactly what you need to do.  Definitely try to take your CS classes with Nelson (everyone calls him by his first name).",4
"Nelson is a great professor. He tells jokes to make class interesting. Some may find this distracting however. I took him for 132 and 216. He's a really nice guy.

The projects are difficult but they can be rewarding.",4
"Good personality with a great sense of humor but that’s about it. Complaints: 
+ His project descriptions do not flow well at all. They often have grammatical errors and information seems to be scattered all over the place, making projects very intimidating for beginners. Explanations do not make much sense at all unless you’re proficient with programming. Instructions for projects are simply horrible to say the least. Either too much info scattered throughout or too little. You’ll spend a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly it is you have to do, unless you’re already good at coding. 
+ His lectures are all over the place. Every minute, he interrupts himself to tell someone to stop talking (even if they weren’t talking). For us beginners, it doesn’t help that he keeps doing that. He should just focus on his presentation and teach us the lectures without interruption. 
If you’re good at coding, take his class. He’s funny and makes class fun. But if you’re new to coding, be careful. His projects will give you constant headaches, and you’ll waste a ton of time trying to make sense of the project briefings. ",1
"His project descriptions are full of grammatically errors and make absolutely no sense at all. 

Every single minute of his lectures, he interrupts himself to tell someone to stop talking even if they aren’t talking. This makes it difficult for us beginners to focus on what he’s saying since he keeps on interrupting himself mid sentence. 
If you’re good at coding, sure, take his class. He’s funny and makes a ton of jokes. 
But if you’re a beginner, beware. His inability to teach the content in an easy-to-understand way, coupled with his convoluted project descriptions, will give you headaches and nightmares. ",0
"First CS professor I've had and seems to be one of my favorite professors so far. CS material can be really confusing but Nelson uses simple analogies to make sure his students understand what's going on. Really engaging as well, both inside and outside the classroom. If you have the chance to take him, do so. ",4
Easy to follow.,3
Amazing professor! Keeps the class entertaining while teaching the material in a well paced manner. ,4
"This is my third time having Nelson as my CS professor (I had him for cmsc131 and cmsc216), and he's growing on me. He makes so many weird/painful jokes in class which makes it difficult for me to focus, but also keeps me awake so that's good haha.

CMSC389N was an alright elective. Midterms were easy as hell and the final probably will be too, but there's a ton of written code required. We had a group project where we had to use php/html, javascript, and bootstrap and that was actually pretty neat and a good group learning experience.

This is a great class for anyone looking to get into php/javascript and web app platforms, or databases. I ended up despising web dev this semester, but it was a good experience to learn some php/html, JS/JQuery, and SQL in case I have to use it in the future... plus Nelson is a laugh, haha. Good luck!",3
Amazing,4
The worst thing about Nelson is that his jokes get really old.,4
"Currently in his 389N class now but this is my third straight spring semester with him as a teacher. Had him two years ago in 132, and last year in 216. So this review will cover all those classes.

132: First time having a class with him and my god he was crazy funny and just all around cool. People don't like him because of his jokes but he does that because he believes that students can only focus for a short period of time and need to take a small break before focusing on the lecture again. I find this VERY effective! He is a really effective teacher. I got a C in 131, barely survived, and when I took Nelson for 132, I had a whole new understanding of the material that was way more invaluable from studying java the previous semester. First time taking his exams at this time as well and he basically makes his real ones the same flavor as the practice exams (because they're all old exams). Naturally he makes the final harder and a little more different but it can be done. 132 was my favorite semester at UMD and nelson was a HUGE part of it. Made me happy to be a CS Major.

216: Ok so i had to retake after fucking it up the semester before with Herman. Most of what I said about 132 can be repeated here as well. Old exams follow the same style as the ones he gives you. The projects, yes are daunting and make you stress a little bit but with a little tenacity it can be done. he made 216 a lot easier for me after Herman ruined it for me. 

389N: It's my most favorite class of the semester. Despite the time its taught in the mornings any class with Nelson is a blast and this class is his ""child"" so to speak. It's web dev which is right up my alley and his passion as well. The first exam was really really (and i mean really) easy. And the projects i can finish in a matter of 2-3 days depending on how much time i spend on them. Unless Nelson offers more classes or teaches more in the upper levels this will most likely be my last semester with him as a teacher :( It was well worth it all three times. He makes you proud to be a CS major.",4
"He's a very funny professor who actually provides a good CS course. His projects are very reasonable, and he even gives code example to help with the projects. Tests are very easy, you just have to practice his old exams that he provides. I never got lower than a B- taking 3 of his classes. CMSC131, CMSC132, CMSC389N.",4
"This guy is basically your favorite high school teacher as a UMD professor.

Really, really good dude.  If you ever have any problems while you're taking his class, you can go to his office hours and talk to him about it and he will do his best to work through those issues with you.  He seriously, legitimately, actually cares about his students, which is something you don't see very often.

As much as I'm tempted to give him a 5 star review, I can't just because he's not a great lecturer.  He's funny in class, but he gets a little off-topic and distracted a lot, so a lot of what you learn from him, you have to learn from his slides outside of class.  He makes this super easy though, because his slides are great and he records all his lectures on panopto, so you can go back over things if you missed something.

All in all, he's one of my favorite professors I've had here and if you get a chance to take a class with him, do it.  You won't be disappointed as long as you actually take the time to talk to him and get to know him.",3
"He is not a very effective lecturer, as I end up teaching most of the material to myself outside of class. He gets distracted very easily and will look to call anyone out that is talking to their neighbor or on their phone, even if they are not bothering anyone. This ends up being a distraction to the entire class and I find it hard to focus or take him seriously. 
He posts lecture slides that are very helpful and they reflect the content that  will be on the exams. He is a fair teacher but I do not enjoy going to lecture. ",2
"My only prior experience to CS was Programming 1 my senior year of HS, and all those topics were covered within the first two weeks of CMSC131 so everything was fairly new. 

Nelson is an incredible professor! He makes the lecturers funny and engages with his students. He really cares for his students and extends projects when he sees fit. Sometimes there are 1 point assignments to boost your grade a little. His lectures are posted online but I highly recommend going to class and then going home to rewatch the lecture and taking notes. I did this for the final exam and scored really high that I wished I did this throughout the semester so that I wouldn't have been crying about the projects. Projects are hard but people are willing to help!! His exams and quizzes are no surprise if you studied and dedicate time for the materials.

I ended up with an A- in the class with the small curve. I highly recommend Nelson!",4
"Good teacher, exams can be vague. ",3
"He is funny and makes lecture interesting, but attendance isn't mandatory and he records lectures. The exams were sometimes difficult but practice exams were released. He responds to student concerns (changed the release tokens from 24 to 12 hours) and is fair.",4
Funny guy who will engage you with his demeanor and slides. If you have been doing well in 131 and 132 you should expect to do well as long as you put in the work for projects.,4
"Don't know why a lot of people hate on Nelson. He's an awesome professor and I thought he explained things to beginner programming students very well compared to other 131 professors. I had experience in Java before coming in, so I didn't have to study as much I guess. I would recommend Nelson over Herman any day. He does make some weird jokes here and there, but if you have at least a little sense of humor, the 75-minute lectures fly by.",3
Great professor. Funny and covers the material well. Class is hard though.,4
"Lived up to the hype. Great and engaging lecturer who cares about his students (overused some jokes, though). Other reviews mention grammatical errors in project specifications, but this was not my experience. Receptive to student concerns.",4
"Great professor. I was lucky enough to have him for both CMSC132 and CMSC216. Straightforward exams, great sense of humor. Encourages the making of memes on Piazza. Very approachable",4
"He is really great at engaging the majority of students but I tended to find his jokes to be childish and distracting. I didn't always feel welcome in his lectures. He had a routine where he would repeatedly pretend to interrupt students while they asked a question, and I found this to be disrespectful. Well-intentioned but lacking execution. His exams and grading are fair, and he gave a decent curve.",2
"Great exams/projects, seems to care about his students. I found myself distracted in lecture a bit by his lecture style, since he tends to go back and forth between topics. Because of this, I think Pedram might be better at conveying the information we needed to learn",3
"Nelson is a really good professor who explains things very well and gives you the resources you need to do well in the class (lecture videos, old exams, discussion questions). His lectures are also entertaining which is something that I miss now that I no longer have him. ",3
"Amazing amazing amazing. Best CS professor in the department honestly. He cares so much about his students, actually understands that we might be going through stuff and offers help. He cares. If you tell me your favorite professor is Fawzi, then I'll know you never experienced having Nelson. Sure, the class is hard. But Nelson gives you a really strong foundation, and motivates you to do the comp sci major. ",4
He's Nelson... enough said,4
"Perfect, approachable, answers questions, funny, and commands classroom ",4
"Took him in Summer 2019. The best!!! Such positive energy and lighthearted jokes to break up the content :) Loved the way he taught the class, so now I'm about to TA for the first time for 216 (not for Nelson tho :(((( )",4
Take nelson.,4
"Amazing professor! Had him freshmen year fall seamster and it was a great way to begin at UMD. He cares about his students and gives them every possible tool needed to succeed. His lectures are super fun and entertaining, and projects and exams are all definitely fair. ",4
This class was very hard but I feel like Nelson made it bearable. He's very funny and keeps you engaged in the material. I didn't really study for the first half of the class so I didn't do so well early on but later on I payed more attention to his lectures and was able to do much better.,4
Great guy,4
"I'm an international student. My native language is not English. And I have to say, if you don't have any background on coding or if you are not an English native speaker, DO NOT TAKE Nelson because he has a thick Spanish accent. It sounds like he was shooting a machine gun. DADADADADA. ",2
"Nelson is a funny guy who makes a lot of jokes, but I didn't really learn that much from him.  I wish I had taken the course with the other instructor.",1
"This man knows how to keep the class engaged, and he's absolutely hilarious. Projects and exams are kind of difficult though, so make sure to really get the material down.",3
Hardest thing ive ever done in my life. It started soooo slow but then it got extremely hard extremely fast and ruthless after learning about objects. Nelson is cool but not for this class.,0
"He's good at explaining concepts. It is a bit distracting when he talks to his students in the recordings (class was asynchronous so we only watched recordings of previous lectures), but it helps with having a mini break in between. His accent is a bit challenging at times, so do not rely on the auto-generated captions. Open to help on Piazza and usually assigns enough time for projects, but you will most likely be directed to a TA for help. He gives lots of time to complete quizzes.",3
"Nelson does a great job of making a potentially boring class, extremely fun. He explains the concepts well and adds in humor to make it bearable. This class is a lot of work, of course, but here are a lot of ways to get help if you need it. I am going to take his classes as many times as I possibly can.",4
"Nelson is a kind professor who will help you navigate your programming career and learning how to learn. He is decent at teaching and makes the class enjoyable. Do not be fooled by his jokes, if this is the first time that you are learning JAVA, be prepared to work hard in this class, the kids who took JAVA is high school will make it harder for you to get a good grade. I would take Nelson over Yoon for sure. Overall, if you can't get Fawzi(hard exams) then you will be ok with Nelson (he is big on giving your old exams and other resources).",3
This is an inherently hard class but Nelson tries his best to make sure everyone is on pace. Office hours are a big help for for this class. The projects are challenging but if you've learned Java before it shouldn't be a big problem. Nelson's lectures/slides are very helpful and he usually does not test on contents he didn't teach. He also really cares about his students' mental health.,4
"One of the best CS professors out there. Yes the class is difficult but Nelson tried to make the material as understandable as possible. 
But halfway through the semester the course feels like it suddenly sped up, so you need to stay on your game the whole time or you will get overwhelmed by new material fast.",4
"All in all an amazing instructor. He is funny, engaging, and gives easy exams and quizzes. I learned a lot from this CMSC132 class when I took him back in Fall 2019. Excellent choice to take. ",4
Definitely one of the best professors at UMD especially because of how easy and fun he makes the lectures. He is the only professor that I have this semester whose class just seems to effortless and fun. Nelson seems more like a friend than a teacher - a great quality for someone looking to be mentored.,4
"Just finishing up the semester and had to give Nelson a review. Out of my 3 semesters here, he’s easily one of the best professors I’ve ever had.

Not only is he hilarious, but he also keeps his lectures engaging, and really tries to get his students to understand what is going on. I have had no actual prior programming experience before coming into this class, and I was able to pick up on concepts really easily, especially with all the examples he hands out. The projects definitely get challenging near the end, but you have plenty of time to finish them and the TA’s can be very helpful. This is not the easiest class, and it definitely has a decent workload, but it was overall enjoyable and a great start towards a computer science degree. Also: HE RECORDS LECTURES! It’s really useful. Fawzi doesn’t to my knowledge.

Some of these 1 star reviews are upsetting me so here’s what I have to say:
- His accent is so slight that you can understand everything he is saying just fine, and his occasional grammatical errors are not at all confusing, just read over the sentence again.
- While this class does get harder as it goes along, as long as you pay attention a good 80% of the time and keep with the work, there is no way you would be able to call this class impossible.
- As far as CMSC131 and CMSC132 go, I have heard that Nelson is one of the easier professors.
- He definitely does more than read his slides. He shows several examples of code for each topic
- He isn’t a big fan of when people talk loudly in his class, but he’s cool about it. I talked with my friend everyday in that class at a low volume and he didn’t mind at all.
- He will ask you to clarify your questions if he doesn’t understand, so be sure to be clear about your issues. The TA’s will help you if he can’t.

I highly recommend if you want to go into CS, take Nelson.",4
"Nelson is clearly a super caring guy. He acknowledges the difficulty of CS and wants everyone to do well. His lectures are also great and he keeps you engaged with jokes and stories. Some people complain that the jokes and stories are a distraction, but they made me more engaged. Just make sure you don't blank out during lectures as you can miss important info. Projects and exams can be tricky, so make sure you are on top of everything. I came in with coding experience so I was fine, but I saw a ton of my friends really struggle.",4
"Okay, so Nelson is a very nice guy, and if you ask for an extension on a project he normally gives it to you but tbh he isn't a good professor. I would not recommend this class to anyone who hasn't taken any programming classes before. This class is super fast-paced and if you fall behind you'll be lost. This class is extremely hard, the tests are what most people fail at because of how hard he makes them. He gives you previous exams to practice but the questions he asks on the exam are totally different. I am talking about studying for 4 days straight and still failing kinda hard. On one exam everyone did bad on and he still didn't curve it or find a way to help us out because of how badly it affected our grades. The projects aren't totally awful until you get near the end of the semester, I would say you are working on a project every day of the week through the semester. But most people do better on the projects than on the exams and that's what helps your grade. There are certain TA's that aren't really much help and it's so difficult to make a meeting with a TA for no reason. I have never seen so many people struggle with one class until I took CMSC131. I really don't recommend this class to anyone and if I could go back in time and not take this class I would. This class ruined my first semester of freshman year. ",0
"IF YOU HAVE NEVER CODED THIS CLASS IS HARDD!!!!

Advice for Class:
There is no way around it, this class is difficult for those with no prior experience or who it doesn't come naturally. Nelson is a decent teacher, but be prepared that he moves really fast. 
Your first 2-3 weeks of semester should just be spent constantly coding small tasks to get familiar with java and eclipse. It will help so much. Also watch YouTube vids to try to get ahead.   The tests are hard as well so prepare early to write your code instead of type. The previous tests he gives as examples are ALWAYS much easier then actual test, so know / understand them like the back of your hand. The projects help you learn the most because they take HOURS. I would have the expectation that each one will take at least 8 hours. start them as soon as they are released and bounce ideas of friends as much as you can. DO NOT CHEAT OR SHOW CODE to others.  the TAs will notice if you copy. Just explain what you did and how in words and you should be okay. Use your peers as support in this class because it is easy to get stuck. 

Nelson review:
He is good teacher will slight accent and decent humor. overall is nice and down to earth(insists you call him nelson). His lectures are not the most organized and he tends to bounce around which can be confusing. Luckily you can watch them back and try to understand.  He is relatively accessible in office hours, but tends to come off as an overpowering personality in person. I suspect this is because he lectures groups more then teaches individuals. I also think he knows this and try's to improve(only somewhat successful).  I am trying to take him next semester for 132. He is defiantly not perfect, but he is far better then some other shit teachers at UMD. 

Ps. People tend to vary in their liking of him because of how much they enjoy his humor in lectures.

"I've never taken a coding class in my life, but I just tried to understand some basics of Java over the summer. However, I didn't really get that far. I was really stressed about taking CMSC131, in fact, I was constantly asking people at UMD how difficult it was for a newbie programmer to adjust to the class before I came here. CMSC131 will take a lot of work and time management, but it is do-able, especially if you have Nelson. He's a great teacher who cares for his students and is willing to be accommodating towards them (deadline extensions, cancellations of quizzes, etc.). He gives you all of the resources you need to do well in his class.  I haven't taken the final yet, but so far, I believe that every test and project we've been given has been fair. He is a example-based lecturer and it works perfectly with my style of learning, but make sure this style fits you if you want to take him.
That said, you will only do well in this class without any previous experience if you are willing to put in the effort. Start projects early and go to TA office hours to clear concepts up. Spend a few days studying for each midterm and make sure to do all the practice exams that you are given. Reach out for help using the free I4C tutoring service or talk directly to Nelson.  ",4
"Nelson is awesome, I swear he is the ideal professor for students who have no CS experience, especially those who are worried about jumping into CS without an understanding of what the major really is. Nelson creates a great environment with humor and takes time to reassure you that CS is not as intimidating as people make it to be. While you do need to be willing to put in the work, he is the most accommodating and patient instructor I've had because he really does care about his students needs. I will definitely be trying my best to take as many classes with the instructor in the future! ",4
"Nelson is a goofball for real - 
My first ever programming class, and I learned a ton, and ended with a good, fair grade. I could find Nelson to be irritating though, if I don't understand a topic, he tends to joke a lot. But he made the class fun, projects were fair (most the time), and the workload was not too bad. 
Issues: Spelling/grammar mistakes in project descriptions, discussions being useless",4
"He is a great professor in the sense that he is funny and tries to keep the class engaged. However, he goes relatively fast throughout the material and it is easy to get lost through the semester. He doesn't give us students enough time to reflect on the material and understand and just keeps going. A lot of the times when I went in for office hours or asked him questions after class, he makes me feel stupid and acts in a way that gives off the vibe that I should already know this. At times he wouldn't even answer the question I had. I have to say though, he is very generous with deadlines and is willing to extend if people request it. He doesn't curve.",2
"Nelson is a great professor, he tries to keep lectures interesting with jokes and takes small breaks every 10 minutes for the class to ask each other questions or just talk. He is good at keeping everyone interacting with each other and encourages people to talk and get to know each other. However, the course, in general, is very difficult, if you have not taken any Computer science courses before, this course is very challenging. I know people who have barely passed this class as they have had no experience, and since this class is fast-paced it is really hard to keep learning new material while also doing the projects. I would really recommend coming in with some level of experience and looking over material that is covered in this class before taking this course.",3
"Nelson is a great professor who I'd really recommend for your first ever CS class. 

He goes through the material throughly and provides plenty of examples during lectures to help you see the actual effect of the concept he is teaching.

However, if you want to do well in this course, please please please start your projects early so that you have more time to submit and seek help from TAs during office hours(He also constantly emphasizes this point).

Use the lecture slides to study and you'll do fine on the tests.",4
"Context: Programmed in Java through an intro to java course in HS as well as APCS A (Not principles).

Honestly, if given the choice between Fawzi and Nelson, I would recommend you take Nelson. BE PREPARED to spend time outside of class learning, digesting, and applying the information taught in class as I felt like Nelson was quick with the material during the lecture. Sources like Alex Lee or w3schools really helped me out when I was lost within the material. Especially with me coming in with prior knowledge of Java and programming, this course definitely challenges you in a good way. Be sure to manage your time well, start your projects early, and always ask questions. If you have no experience programming before, you're going to have to spend a lot of time reviewing and learning the material for the first time as it's a lot, especially with the pace. I believe my grade within the class was fair, as I know I could've applied myself more to fully understand the material. This class should be on your higher level of priority (The same level/effort as MATH140 for me at least). In the end, I learned a lot from Nelson and do not regret taking the class with him.

Pros:
- Recorded Lectures
- Lectures, programs, and in-class notes are always posted online
- Provides sample exams/quizzes for students to prepare for prior to midterms/finals.
- Allows you to have your laptop out during class (NOTE: I have heard that Fawzi does NOT allow laptops out during class).
- Always understanding/flexible with scheduling conflicts --> not afraid to move assignment/test deadlines further when asked

Cons:
- Can be fast with the material he goes through
- (Did not bother/affect me at all) Has a slight accent
- (To some people this might be a con) Brief moments during class to reflect what was learned to classmates + ask questions
- Sometimes he can joke around too much to the point where it'll take away from the class time (Did not annoy me, a review from someone earlier mentioned this and I also believe it's true).
- Does not use Canvas. Nelson uses his own website for posting projects details, slides, sample programs, etc...
- (Not a con for me) Uses Piazza for class announcements + addressing student questions/concerns/memes (yes there is a meme folder for the class, pretty dope).",3
"Nelson is great!!! If you're the type of person to get kind of bored during boring old slide lectures then he's good for you! He relies on examples in the lecture and a few small concepts from the slides. He gives us one-minute breaks in between heavy topics/examples so that we can discuss it with our neighbors, which I find really helpful in keeping everyone interactive and actually paying attention esp in a morning class. His exams are doable as long as you do the past exams/practice he gives which is really helpful. His third exam; however, was overly long and challenging compared to his others so it tanked a lot of people's grades, but he just released grades and seemed to have provided a better cutoff to benefit (f.e. some A grades were considered A+ and so on), so as long as you put the work in you should be golden in terms of your grade (it's not meant to be challenging to get an A or B). Also, his projects are definitely on the challenging side sometimes especially later in the year with Recursion and the class implementations, but if you study his class lecture code and ask for help during office hours (always go early otherwise you probably won't get a chance if it's close to the project deadline). Overall, he explains things effectively for the most part and I'd recommend reading some notes on the topics before coming into class on the first day just so you have a good idea of what coding in Java is about and you aren't bombarded too fast! He does not curve, but his grades are pretty fair. I really enjoyed his class and it's insane to me how much I learned in just three months! I totally recommend Nelson",4
"public static void main(String[] args) {
/*
Nelson is a great professor. He is really laid back, chill, and constantly makes jokes and finds interesting ways to keep students engaged. This was my first time coding in Java and Nelson made it very straight forward and doable.

Pros:
- Nelson is a very funny and likable guy. On the first day of classes he will tell you that he always wants you to call him by his first name which I found interesting.
- He is very good at making analogies between programming and more understandable topics. For example, he would make an analogy between a bakery and objects in java. This makes it really easy to understand his teaching, even for first time programmers like me.
- His lecture slides are much more detailed than Fawsi's (from what I have heard)
- His exams are very much like the previous exams. As long as you study those, and the additional resources that Nelson provides, you will be more than fine on the exams.
- Occasionally during every lecture, Nelson likes to say ""1 minute"" which indicates that we can talk to our neighbor for a minute and digest the information that he just lectured about. I found this useful and made the class less fast paced— gave me time to breathe while learning new information. After this minute break, he opens the floor for a few questions before returning to his lecture.
- Nelson uploads the code for every class example and provides many many resources to ensure you do well on the projects and exams.
- Grading for exams is honestly pretty lenient. Because all the midterms include hand-written coding, it is easy to miss the small nuances that come with programming but the TAs that grade your tests know this. Often times when you look at the grading break down, you are given points on a segment of code just for ""ATTEMPTING to _______""
- Very accommodating in regards to extending deadlines for things. He even encourages that the class speaks up if we need an extension.

Cons:
- His funny personality sometimes gets in the way of the actual teaching. Yes it does lighten up the mood but often he will stop mid sentence just to pop in a joke. Additionally, some of his comedy is offensive or will get stale. For example, he once made a statement to the guys in the class about how they should not feel bad if a girl rejects them. He then goes on with his joke and says that girls are like ""instance variables"" and how the guys should just ""pick another one"" if one doesn't work. If you know anything about Java, you will know that he basically just called women ""objects"". I didn't think too much about this but I can see why some people would find his humor offensive. He also always makes the joke ""turn to your neighbor and tell them they are a (insert random java terminology)"" which literally makes no sense and gets old after the first couple times.
- The third midterm was a nightmare. In the past, there have only been two midterms and the third was only added a couple years ago. This means that there is little study material and the worst part is that the second and third midterm are only 2 weeks apart since they kind of just shoved it into the curriculum. The class average for midterms is usually pretty high but dropped to a D average for this midterm. Nelson did adjust the letter grade cut offs for final grades because of this though.
- Projects become very challenging towards the end of the semester. This is obviously necessary to challenge students but sometimes they are impossible to figure out without a TA.
- Frankly, sometimes it is difficult to understand his accent and it leaves you to think more about what words he is saying in the first place rather than the actual content within his sentences.

Overall, I think Nelson is the better option for CMSC131. He is very knowledgable and it is clear that he comes prepared for class with examples to explain complex ideas to new programmers. Just beware of his random remarks. It is clear that he is looking for validation and wants to be liked by his students so he makes jokes on topics that students our age would find ""funny"". If you can get past the cringe factor, this class will great.

"Nelson is a cool professor. I will try to create a pros and cons table for you, the reader, to understand my mind.

[PROS]
- He's funny.
- Does not require attendance, so you can watch his lecture videos on Canvas. 
- Projects are fun.
- He's nice.
[CONS]
- Sometimes the jokes get annoying, especially when you're trying to learn. As stated in other comments, he will sometimes just say jokes randomly (which can be funny at times), but as the days went by the jokes became old.
- You really gotta pay attention if you don't know the material and talk to TAs constantly if you don't know anything. If anything, the TAs are more helpful than Nelson himself.
- As anecdotal evidence, he created a 3rd exam (in the past there were only 2) which covered a bunch of topics. I went to the exam review and the TA told us not to review this one topic. Next thing you know that topic is on the exam!!! I heard that half of the class did POORLY on that exam (including me). I went from a B to a C overnight. 
- Projects are fun but require a ton of logic. I had to use external sources to find out topics that I did not understand.
- Exams and quizzes are done on PAPER. You really have to know Java word by word or you are dead. For slow writers, good luck because you only have about 20-40 minutes to do about 3-4 methods.

[CONCLUSION]
If you do not know Java, LEARN IT prior to taking this class. If you do not have ANY knowledge, you are screwed. Gladly I had some coding knowledge that helped me in the long run. Learn how to code and how to write it. Overall, great class but annoying coursework.",3
"I think Nelson was a rather good professor, and a good lecturer. He often made jokes and gave people breaks. I must say however, some of the jokes were directed at students (Madison, if you're seeing this, I hope the U.S.S. Nelson didn't hit too hard). If you left class early, he would begin to fake cry, which admittedly was funny, but if you need to leave the class early then just expect that. He would also repeatedly tell people to be quiet, which had interrupted class a fair bit. I also felt some of the multiple choice on the tests were a little random, but other than that, he was really good. He did provide a lot of extensions (which helped a ton of people), and ended up curving the class because of one of the exams having a low average. Take him if you need breaks during lecture, want some extensions, or generally just want a funny professor to laugh with. ",3
"Nelson does his best to keep the lectures entertaining and tries to adjust deadlines whenever possible. It's a bit hard reaching out to him or his TA for help, but the website he uses along with other instructors takes up most of that. In general you'll be all good if you took a Computer Science that covered the basics beforehand, including the ones in high school. If you're coming to this class with no prior knowledge, you might find yourself lost at some times, as he starts his lectures with the assumption that you already know the basics. You will have a project almost every week, with rising difficulty, so it is highly recommended you start your work as soon as possible. Submitting your projects last minute is difficult, since the website can go down from how many people are doing the same. There is almost no flexibility once the deadline passes, and the late penalty hits hard. Study when you should, don't hesitate to go to office hours, and don't be afraid to reach out for help, as it will be difficult to recover once you fall behind. Don't be afraid to ask for anything, since if it's possible he can push deadlines back by a week, but don't rely on it, since procrastination does hit hard in this class. Otherwise, taking the course with him isn't all too bad.",3
"Nelson is one of the best cs teachers. period. If you have the option to take him, take him. He makes the course super easy to get through and he's super funny.",4
"Nelson is good professor, with entertaining lectures that are relatively easy to follow. While CMSC131 is not the most beginner-friendly introductory course, that isn't really a knock on Nelson. He wasn't the most accessible for help at times, but that was the only complaint I had. Overall, still a good professor who I'd take again. ",3
"Nelson is simply fantastic! Super passionate, engaging, and offers so many resources for students to be successful! His exams are also very fair, especially if they're online. Best instructor for computer science at UMD by a mile. Had him for CMSC133 too.",4
Great professor likes to tell a lot of jokes. Class is easy if taken in high school if not make sure you prepare before you take it. Nelson is a great lecturer also was very helpful by giving online resources such as videos of him lecturing. Also great for freshman cares about his students and wants them to adjust to college.,4
"I like Nelson a lot, I had him for 131, just took him for 132, and am planning on taking 216 with him. 
Yes he can get carried away sometimes with messing around, but he teaches you absolutely everything that you need to know for projects/quizzes/exams.
Everyone I've ever met who doesn't like Nelson has just been lazy and didn't care to understand what he was saying.
Great fun guy.",4
"Nelson is a super funny guy, and he really cares about preparing his students for the future. Very helpful in office hours. In addition to teaching material very efficiently and being very responsive to feedback, Nelson will teach you to advocate for yourself, a skill that is useful for the rest of your life. He is very specific about how to prepare for exams and projects and provides many resources. Amazing professor.",4
"The nicest, most understanding teacher. His classes are entertaining and he really makes an effort to get to know his students (even in a huge lecture). He presents the information clearly and the tests are very fair. The projects take time but he preps his TAs really well to help. Not an easy class, AT ALL, but Nelson goes above and beyond for his students. Also has very good slides and all classes are recorded (he posts the slides before class and the recordings the second class ends). ",4
"Nelson made this course easy, and he knew it. Absolute king. I went to lecture, but you could easily get away without ever watching lecture. A lot of stuff you can find on the internet or in the lecture examples. I was a bit worried about this course because I found his 131/132 courses to be tricky at times (especially with exams), but Nelson kept this course very straightforward and minimized exam difficulty. I have nothing bad to say about this course except for the fact that I wish it provided more depth on practical skills. We only got into Node towards the end. However, part of what made this course easy was the lack of depth so yk... But yeah, def a chill elective with a wonderful prof!",4
"This class was alright. Nelson's projects are not well-written in my opinion, and it's hard to understand what is actually wanted us to do. Sometimes, it's also hard to understand where to begin the projects, but that's different for everyone of course. Nelson made the exams pretty easy though, especially the final exam. He's also responsive through Piazza and understood if we needed deadlines pushed back for projects, so I most definitely appreciated that. Discussions are alright, but they are definitely not necessary to attend. ",3
"Genuinely a wonderful person. You can tell that he really cares about his students and wants everyone to succeed. The course itself was pretty easy, although Nelson didn't go too in depth into the particulars of most topics, just focused on an overview and how to do things without too many details. That's not my favorite way of learning information (jumping right into looking at code), but the exams and projects were fairly straightforward. I always felt like I knew what to do and like I could get help whenever I needed it. He records every class, which makes it easy to do well even if you can't make it to every lecture or discussion.",4
"I’ve taken CMSC131 and 132 with him and he is great. His lectures are good paired with great slides(and are recorded!), cares about students (if you ask him for extensions he will most likely give it if majority needs it), and makes the class enjoyable. He can be annoying sometimes(calling out people a lot) or fooling around, but if you don’t care about that he’s a pretty good lecturer. He gives you past quizzes and exams so you know what to expect on the midterms/quizzes (not including finals though). His code examples are really good to refer to for projects in 216. In my opinion, if 216 is the only class you’re taking in the summer you shouldn’t be too worried about the projects and exams. Just start early on the projects and do all of the practice he gives you for the exams. If you do that and try, you will at least pass with a B. If you’re willing to get ahead in the summer, I would say go for it.",4
"216 is the only course at UMD that I've taken so far, and it was great. Nelson was awesome, it sucks a bit that the class size was ~120 students, but that's UMD I guess. This class was very fast paced during the summer but Nelson made it manageable.
+ He's funny
+ He's dad
+ He's nice",4
This guy is the GOAT. He gives practice exams that closely mimic the exam you will be taking. The multiple choice is almost identical and the coding is very similar to the lecture examples and much easier than the projects. The projects are tricky though so make sure to start them early. Lectures are easy to understand and his jokes make class enjoyable. If you don't have an internship in the summerI highly recommend taking this class as he makes this difficult course so much easier. ,4
This dude is amazing,4
"Nelson is funny, smart, understanding, and super helpful. He is not the traditional college professor in that he really seems to care about each of our success in a deep and person way. He is super nice and gives great advice to be successful in CMSC and life in general. I would recommend this professor to anyone taking any class which he teaches. He is great so I would take him, if you have the chance.",4
"Nelson is an amazing professor. His lectures are very detailed and he keeps his audience engaged which is super important. He is honestly one of the most understanding professors i've ever seen as he is flexible, helpful, and will always be fair when grading. He is also super funny which helps me stay engaged in the class and genuinely want to go to office hours and every lecture. TAKE HIM if you get the chance, you will not regret it!",4
"I am taking this course during the fall of 2022.
Nelson is the GOAT. Genuinely an amazing lecturer and an even better person. I wish he taught more upper-level classes so that I can take more classes with him.
Always keeps the class engaged by making funny jokes.
Amazing teaching skills, he discusses a topic and then immediately shows an example.
Records lecture and immediately posts them. Attendance is not required unless it's exam day
Exams are extremely fair, nothing scary.
Projects are not super challenging but do not wait till the last minute to implement them.


AMAZING PROFESSOR MUST TAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
"Nelson is extremely student-friendly for a class that can be very challenging for beginners. He records all his lectures which is a life saver for so many. He also gives out plenty of extensions for projects and is very supportive throughout them. He is excellent and, in my opinion, a must-take for any beginner coder like myself. A very engaging, energetic, helpful, detailed, and hard-working professor that I will make sure to take whenever possible.",4
"Man, do I love this guy. Absolutely love him. His project descriptions are very slightly confusing at times, but you have Piazza, other students, and the TAs to clarify the descriptions. His lectures are recorded (and Nelson talks about this very often) so if you're feeling sick, you don't have to come to lecture. Honestly, because he records the lectures, you don't REALLY have to come to class... but I went anyway even though it was in the morning because I was absolutely stoked about his lectures. He has a nice sense of humor and he tries to take advantage of that ""hip professor"" image, which I guess he's doing well. That could be why his jokes might get a bit old by the end of semester and possibly might tick you in the wrong direction, but he's a nice guy. Very lenient for makeups and extensions AS LONG AS you have a valid excuse! Get familiar with him and he might call you out during lectures but it's good to befriend a prof. Oh and Nelson is very good at teaching. When he introduces a new topic, he makes funny descriptions and connects the material to prior knowledge so that beginner students can understand them quicker. Will be taking CMSC132 with him next semester!",4
"Nelson is one of the most understanding professors I have ever met in my life. Maybe it's because he's a POC, but he just gets us. He understands that we are poor, so he doesn't make us get a textbook (everything is recorded/on slides). There are endless examples of concepts. He is EXTREMELY lenient on project extensions and teaches us how to negotiate deadlines. You will not get the full experience with Nelson unless you sit in the front and ask questions. Otherwise, you'll just sit in the back and roll your eyes over how many times he cracks a joke. Paying attention in lecture was extremely difficult for me because I sat in the back and was not engaged.",3
"Epic class, Epic professor. Everything is set up so perfectly. Attendance is optional. All resources in one place, reasonable exams and projects. Take this course if it all fits your plans.",4
"I really liked Nelsons personality because he was funny, caring, and understanding. However, I can't say I enjoyed the lectures. At the beginning I was fine because he makes lectures fun, but I got more tired of his endless banter as the semester dragged on. He interacts A LOT with students, which made lectures very distracting and hard to follow along with. Most of the lectures I went to, I found myself not paying attention because he would go off on long tangents about unrelated things. He is a very easy professor though. Keep in mind, I had taken Comp Sci A AP in high school so I understood most of the concepts, but all of the projects were manageable (and in my opinion easy). His exams weren't necessarily easy for everyone, but I never got below a C on any of the 3 midterms even though I never studied (once again, I had already learned most of the topics that were covered in class, so I'm sure people who have never taken a comp sci class had a much different experience than me). Also, he reused a lot of multiple choice questions from his past midterms. I suspect the final exam was also written by him, because the multiple choice questions were very similar if not the same as some of the questions on past midterms. I finished the final exam with about 45 minutes left, so it was extremely doable. I won't be taking him next semester because I've heard Fawzi prepares you better for future comp sci classes and is a better lecturer (and a harder professor), but if you're looking for someone easy, I would take Nelson.",3
Nelson is really funny. And he records his lectures. And he records his lectures.,4
"Fair course, faster paced 131",4
"Nice person and good professor overall.
This lectures were good and his projects were fair.
He understands how stressful college can be and trys to accommodate.

Only complate is that sometimes his exams material we have just learned and his review guides have a lot of topics which never actually get tested.",3
Nelson is so funny and knows what he is doing.,4
"The course is structured well, and Nelson is an honest and caring professor. There's a discussion board where one can ask whatever questions they have 24/7, lectures are recorded and posted; the exams and quizzes are fair, especially due to Nelson's explicit listing of what will be on the exam; and later in the semester, Nelson establishes two deadlines for projects, making it easier for students to pace themselves so they may complete projects in time. His lectures are great too, and he allows for ""turn and talks"", which can be beneficial to many. My only gripe is that Nelson would frequently go off course, which may be a huge problem to some who simply wish for instructional content only: in my case, it was a slight issue. Aside from such, his projects aren't as graphically appealing as other professors who teach 131 (like Fawzi), and instructions may be unclear at times. That being said, usage of the discussion board is highly recommended. Additionally, Nelson is fair with extensions on projects classwide, if you ask, so don't be shy — sit in the front! He's lovely.",4
"He explains things easily, he records his lectures, his exams are easy. Overall great professor and he's way easier than Fawzi.",4
"Nelson is decent, but I do feel like he could be better. There's a website called Piazza where students can ask and answer questions, and TAs and Nelson himself are active on there too, posting announcements and answering questions. This is definitely helpful when you're working on a project and confused on wording, for instance. All lectures and discussions are recorded and available on Canvas, so if you ever miss a day or want to go back on a concept discussed in a lecture or discussion, you can always do so. The projects really weren't hard, but that might not be true for others because I have previous programming experience and many others in the class do not. Just make sure to start them early and get them done with; I usually finished projects a day or two after they were released so I could focus on other classes. That being said, I do feel like his exams were frustrating. If you misinterpret what a question is asking (you can't ask a TA or Nelson on wording either; they won't and can't really help you on that without giving you hints on it) you will lose points, even if you knew the answer to another interpretation of a question. However, I do feel like the content itself on the exams were very fair, and he did give information on possible content the exams would have. His final is pretty easy as long as you go over previous midterms and finals. The thing that annoyed me the most were lectures, because while Nelson joked around and gave us time to talk to our classmates, he spent a lot of time off-track and I felt like this could have been better used to teach us concepts from 132 and above. He does give you knowledge that you will see or need to understand later (such as memory maps, and you will need to understand how memory in a program works in 216), but I feel like he could have done more in this regard. Lectures were genuinely boring for me; I tried following what he was showing us at the start of the semester, but began to work on other assignments or projects for other classes and multitask while he was lecturing later in the semester. If I didn't do this, I genuinely dozed off.",3
"""Nelson = best teacher"" has become something of its own myth at UMD. From all of these reviews you can see that he has many rabid fans. 

Effectively, this is a man who is SICK AND TIRED of teaching CMSC131. He gives off comments such as ""I will be teaching this class till retirement"" and ""well, the paycheck keeps coming and that's what matters"". 

Nelson also has an awful way of communicating. He sends massive email blasts, often multiple times every single day. These are weirdly formatted and read like strange tweets, and often completely irrelevant. I wish he would actually put some thought into the emails he bombards his 800 students with. 

Sure, he replies to emails and you can go to his office hours. But you will never meet with him for more than a few minutes.

One day he suddenly decided that all TA office hours would be cut short and go online. His reasoning was this: 

""I was walking along that building at night, when I suddenly felt this urge: I want to MUG somebody!  That was when I decided that this place was too dangerous for my TAs.""

During lecture, he CONSTANTLY gets distracted, cracks lame jokes, and picks on you. It is actually better to just watch his lecture recordings. because he edits out all the wasted time. 

Despite his nonsense, Nelson is very lenient with project extensions and make-up exams. Apparently his exams are easier than Fauzi's as well. Maybe I will choose him solely based off of this fact next semester, because now I know that I should never attend lecture anyways.",1
"Nelson is fair with his grading and is funny. Although he does not curve and his class is fast-paced, he is understanding, provides review for midterms through previous exams, and he records his lectures.

Good professor",3
"Awesome dude, taking him again for 132",4
"Nelson is very understanding and lenient on due dates. Highly recommend the course. Low stress while still getting a background in web dev.
Doesn't require coming to class and records all lectures",4
"Absolute sweetheart, funny, and caring. Despite having hundreds of students, he makes sure to memorize people’s names during lecture and interacts with students in a way that keeps lecture lighthearted and easy to feel comfortable in. He has an interesting way of pacing his lectures- it may seem that his pauses to allow for individual discussion and jokes cut the total amount of material learned, but it doesn’t. He is still a lecturer that can teach you a lot about java while also making it digestible and not overwhelming, especially for someone like me with zero prior coding experience. His humor is wonderful and him allowing us to talk to other students at certain points of his lecture makes the material that may seem daunting at first much more manageable. His exams are fair and he gives out many practice exams that you can do to succeed. I only got a B because I slacked off in the middle of the semester- with Nelson, as long as you attend lecture and engage in the content, you will absolutely succeed.",4
"I think it's a myth that he is one of the best professors. I am switching to Fawzi next semester. For simplicity I will make a pro and con list 
Pros
- Website is easy to navigate. 
- Projects, once you get the hang of them after the first few, are easy and the single most helpful thing for my learning
- At surface level seems a nice, personable man
- Gives extensions for projects easily
- Him and TAs responsive on Piazza

Cons
- Overall, not a good lecturer: Disorganized, hard to follow examples. Even the pauses during lectures, half the time when we were supposed to discuss what he just told us, the people around would just look at each other and talk about something else because no one could pay attention long enough to understand what he said. 
             - To follow up on that, he claimed that ""I get about 20 minutes of your undivided attention per lecture, the rest is filler and jokes"". I have other professors who were able to capture everyone's attention the entire time. He's just unable to keep attention because he is all over the place. He tries to make up for this and get our attention with jokes, which I will address. 
-  The jokes were funny at first but got boring and just seems to be pandering and trying to get our attention, which he couldn't. 
- The exams are graded pretty harshly, and some of the material on the multiple choice questions was never specifically addressed in class.
- My TA was awful and unhelpful in answering questions, which didn't help. I hope you're luckier in this regard.",1
Nelson is a really great professor. He keeps lectures fun and engaging and explains challenging concepts really well. His quizzes and exams are not super difficult (they’re pretty much identical to the sample exams so as long as you study those you should be fine). TA office hours ran pretty much 9-5 weekdays so it’s easy to get help. Some of the projects were challenging and they definitely require the full amount of time to work on them so don’t procrastinate! I think this class would be more difficult for someone without CS experience but still definitely doable as long as you start work early and get help when you need it.,4
"Nelson was a great professor imo. He brought humor to lecture, although I barely went and just watched recordings. Discussions arent mandatory so I only went to one discussion session which had a quiz. The midterms were easy and were basically clones of the past midterms which he gives you to study off of. Projects werent that bad I just recommend starting them when they are released. Most of the projects were very to the example code shown in the lecture or on the class site with a bit more complexity to it. I fortunately had some prior java experience so I was fine with following the topics, but I do think without experience it could seem pretty fast for some people.",4
"This class is basically cmsc131 but you just meet less. I don't think it was a particularly easy course but I would say it was fair. As an average student, I did have to spend some time in office hours. Do not start the projects late. Nelson was a really kind and helpful professor for this and even extended some deadlines for us when we requested him to do so. Overall, you should be ok if you put in effort in this class",3
"You need to take this class an elective with Nelson.

Nelson is the best. Period.

There are 3 tests and he gives you a test from the previous year that is basically the same thing, with different numbers.

The projects are all super easy and straight-forward, while also making you learn the topic. He also gave extensions for almost every project which was always a nice surpise.

I wish we spend less time on html in the beginning and spend more time with React/Angular, but overall, great class and great teacher.",4
Annoying as hell. Makes stupid jokes during the class and is not good at explaining.,0
"Had Nelson for CMSC 131 in fall 2022 and he's the best CS professor I've ever had. Like it's not even close. He genuinely cares about his students and will do just about anything to help you succeed. I ended up doing horribly on the second midterm and when I emailed him asking for help, he told me to meet him in his office hours. I went there and the man spent over 30 minutes with me going over my entire test in detail like what I got wrong and how to avoid falling into the traps I fell into going forward (which helped big time). His lecture slides and in-class code were very helpful and enabled me to finish the projects in a timely manner. He would dig deep into different complex methods and better explain them using analogies which I also found very helpful. The projects can be challenging but are doable if you don't procrastinate and start on time. He's also very understanding and will grant extensions if necessary. Exams are a mixed bag but for the most part, if you complete the practice exams he provides, you should be fine. If there is one complaint I have about his class, it has to be the amount of unnecessary stoppages that eventually start to get pretty annoying (like a student may not be paying attention and if Nelson notices, he'll stop lecturing for a few moments and press him/her on the spot) and the sometimes corny jokes he'd blurt out during lecture. Despite this, I overlooked all of this and quite frankly didn't really care at all because I was gaining a lot out of his class despite the fact that I had prior coding experience.

All this being said, if you have the opportunity to take 131 (or any other class) with Nelson, DO IT! You won't regret it. He is very friendly and shows that he cares about his students. He will give you the necessary resources to do well in his class and he's perfect if people who have little or no coding experience.",4
Nelson is the chillest professor. He understands students needs and teaches important material. This class was very easy though. Projects are mostly changing things from the examples he has in class. The tests are a lot of info to memorize but I found that it wasn't graded so harshly.,4
"He is a funny teacher, but he gets off topic way too much. If you are looking for an easy grade, this is a good professor, but he is not that good of a teacher.",2
Straightforward and funny professor who teaches you the fundamentals. Great for people getting into web development. I would recommend Nelson 100% for CMSC335,4
"When first learning how to code I would say Nelson is the absolute best as he gives a lot of leeway in all types of situations. Such as extensions for just any reason and is fairly quick with his responses. Exams are all fair and can be a cakewalk if you study the previous exams throughly. In any scenario where he can help you he will. Projects actually matter in that they actually count for a significant amount of the class and they are all fairly easy. MOST IMPORTANTLY ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF ASK FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED(increased tokens, extensions on projects, etc…).",4
"Nelson is great. He's really funny and understands student's struggles. 335 was a very useful class, and extremely manageable. Projects were basically just adapting what examples he did in class and there was no final exam, just a final project. Would definitely recommend.",4
"Nelson is a very chill and funny professor. Lectures are recorded and projects and exams are very straightforward. The course covers express, node, and MongoDB, so you do learn some valuable information as well. Definitely recommend taking this course.",4
"Nelson's lectures could be more focused, but honestly just having a professor who cares about your well-being is more important to me, and that's what you'll get. He is very compassionate when you have extenuating circumstances or need an extension for some reason or another. He's funny too, but don't talk too loudly or he'll call you and your friends out.",4
"His TAs are HORRIBLEEEE. I had both Fawzi and Nelson, and Fawzi's TAs are way more helfpul when it comes to projects. Nelson is for people that kind of know how to code already, and Fawzi is for people who have little experience coding and want to learn more.Sometimes I feel like going to Nelson's lecture is pointless. He does record everything, but his lecture slides are self explanatory. He is an average professor.",2
"I had CMSC133, CMSC132, and CMSC216 with Nelson. He basically taught me how to code from the ground up. His lectures are funny, and explains concepts really well. Always releases a bunch of exam prep material, that was super helpful. He listens to student feedback and makes changes accordingly. I would recommend taking any class with Nelson.",4
In 216 he's an actual God he makes the class super manageable and explains concepts really well. Even though he jokes around like he usually does he has extra time to explain everything. He also posts videos of him explaining things with zero jokes. If you're going to take 216 nelson is the man and will carry you success it's worth it taking it in the summer just because he's teaching. If you want an A and learn everything take nelson if you want to barely pass and come away with nothing take the other choices for 216.,4
I am so grateful for this man. He is truly the people's teacher.,4
"Pros: 
-He is extremely friendly
-His exams are easy as they have similar if not the same question from some of the previous exams (which he gives you access to)
-There are a lot of review materials to study 
-He records the lectures so you don't have to attend
-His TAs are very helpful 
-You have Piazza as a resource to ask questions

Cons:
-I took it in the summer so there was a class every day so if you missed a class you were automatically behind 
-Some of the projects were very hard so you must start early
-There are no breaks in the class as soon an assignment is due the next one is released
-There is no curve, however, you shouldn't need it
-Some of the project and exercise descriptions were confusing, especially the last project and exercise

Overall, most of the cons are not Nelson's fault, but the course structure comes with the professor. If you have the option to take you should take him. TLDR he is the GOAT and I stan Nelson and you will too once you take him!",4
"I was debating giving Nelson 4 or 5 stars, because if there's one drawback to him, the class isn't really as comprehensive as other professors from what I've heard.  For example, Larry and Yoon teach assembly with MIPS, whereas we get AVR.  I don't know MIPS much at all, but for one it has an explicit frame pointer unlike AVR, and I believe they have to learn about stack frames right off the bat, whereas we learned it as a subtopic during the last week.  I still don't know how frame pointers work in assembly, as we really didn't go over it at all, but I could probably learn fairly quickly by the time I take ENEE350 next semester.  It's still a whole lot better doing AVR assembly than going into ENEE350 blind like most EE's do.

Honestly though, that's a minor nitpick compared to the benefits it gives.  For one, Nelson's exams aren't hard in the slightest.  They're like Pedram's, but much easier.  The averages for the three semester exams ranged from 87-91%.  For the most part, they're pretty fair in not testing crap no one cares about, and when it does pop up on occasion, it's not worth a whole lot of the exam.  Most of the weight are in the coding questions, and they are pretty easy.  If that's not enough, Nelson gives us so much review material.  For exams 1 and 2, he gave us material dating back to 2014.  For exam 3, he gave us a ton of process worksheets and quizzes.  The final review material was a bit lacking, as nothing really covered threads all that well, but that's minor if you could understand exercise 6 and actually watched the lecture videos at the end.  Even then, the final was only worth 10% of the grade, so if you did well on everything else it's nothing to worry about.

The exercises and projects were kinda neat, but it was kinda back to back to back on that front.  Just, please work on them early.  If you get stuck, especially if you can't go to in-person office hours, virtual office hours were pretty crowded this summer by the project due dates, so go early.  You may lose some secret test points here and there as I did, but if your implementation is mostly correct, it shouldn't be a big issue regarding your overall course grade, granted you do well on the exams.

If you do take this course over the summer and want to do it mostly asynchronously, as Nelson set up another section just for this, just please don't try and take advantage of Nelson.  It will not work.  Piazza was kind of a nightmare this summer, and part of that was due to requests like ""can the lowest project be dropped,"" despite the grading scheme being clearly laid out in the syllabus at the start of the semester.  Nelson laid out from the beginning of the semester that this is a very demanding course, and he cannot grant extensions for arbitrary reasons (he is very lenient about extensions and whatnot when it comes to genuine issues unrelated to workload).  Unless you have plenty of experience in C and assembly, you will likely struggle at some point in the course, so start things early.  Even worse, do not attempt to cross Nelson by cheating.  He is not lenient at all about academic dishonesty, and he will request an XF if he has any proof of someone cheating.  He has the terms laid out in the syllabus like just about every CS professor.

If you can pick things up semi-quickly, and you don't flood yourself with other responsibilities, you will have a good time in this course.  Nelson said at the beginning that if you do your part, there's a good chance you'll get an A in his class.  It's certainly doable to take this alongside either another class or a job/internship, but just know that the class doesn't slow down because you're doing that.

Overall, with some of the horror stories I've heard about 216 (particularly with Yoon), this class was nothing like that.  It was exceedingly fair in my opinion, and Nelson genuinely wanted us to succeed.",4
"Nelson is an absolute gem of a professor. He is truly passionate about CS and wants all of us to succeed. In high school, I didn't really enjoy CS that much, but coming to UMD and taking Java with Nelson was one of the best decisions I could have possibly made. I am very grateful to have had him for all of the CS introductory courses - 131, 132 and 216. Absolutely do take Nelson, especially if you have just entered UMD and are starting with 131.",4
Nelson is the goat. Best computer science teacher especially when breaking into computer science and wanting to become interested int he field. He makes it interesting and informative. I love you,4
"Ngl if you don't already know java it is hard to learn from him. He's a really nice guy, but class time is mainly spent just joking around. I personally already knew Java, but I can see how if I didn't have any experience coding beforehand I would struggle in the class. Still a really nice and funny guy tho, class assignments overall pretty easy.",3
The best CS prof that I ever had,4
"Nelson is an absolute gem of a professor. He explains everything very clearly/eloquently, goes over lots of examples in lecture, and makes content digestable and engaging. He has a passion for CS and teaching that comes across in his teaching method, which includes good humor and 1 minute respites to talk to the person next to you about content (if you don't understand smth or if you got lost during lecture). He also posts the lecture recordings (godsent)! He manages to make the course very engaging. Additionally, he's genuinely a really nice person. I had an accident that really uprooted my semester, but Nelson was very understanding and accommodating. He understands that students are people too and life happens. If you have the opportunity to take a class with Nelson, do it. You won't regret it one bit I promise. Singlehandedly one of the best professors at UMD. Additionally, the TAs for CMSC131 are all very kind and helpful (thank you Fatima, Gavin, and Henna)",4
"DO NOT TAKE NELSON IF YOU HAVE NEVER CODED BEFORE. I feel like he is a very FUNNY professor, but as someone who has never taken a CS course before, he is IMPOSSIBLE to follow. He jumps from different concepts very quickly, and this, paired with him making a joke every 2 minutes, makes it really tough to fully understand the concepts if you're actually trying to learn. I think something people don't tell you is MOST of the people in 131 have taken AP Comp Sci in high school but just didn't do well enough on the exam to test out of 131, so they at least have some basic understanding of coding. Therefore they enjoy the jokes he makes class since they have seen most of the material before and don't need to really sit down and think about new concepts. Don't get me wrong, I think he's a fun break from classes if you have a background in coding! However, if you've never done coding before, you will surely struggle. I would've MUCH rather taken Pedram as his lecture style is very straight forward.",1
"Nelson is fantastic! He makes an effort to learn names of people despite his lectures being huge. He is funny and cares about students well being. He is also very responsive to student complaints. For example, if he sensed that people were behind on a project he would give us extra release tokens or an extension. He records lectures and gives comprehensive exam review guides.",4
"I took this class over the summer along with 250 and it was manageable. If you don't have any internship then you can take both classes. Nelson makes this class very easy. He is a very good professor and records his lectures. Projects are fairly easy and same thing with exams. I barely put any effort into this class, that's why I got a C+, otherwise, an A is very doable. Highly recommend him.",4
"Great class! Good if you want an introduction to Web Development. Also good if you need an extra CS class that's not too difficult or time-consuming.
 Lectures are optional and if you skip them you'll be fine because the material is all online. The exams were easy and the projects were easy also and not too time-consuming.",4
"my favorite teacher! he keeps the class light and cracks lots of jokes but is great at teaching the material. really easy quizzes, tests, and projects but you still learn a lot. definitely recommend him!",4
"While I was scared to go into this class, even with 2 years of programming knowledge from high school, Nelson helped me feel so much better about CS as a whole and I've learned far more about programming in this semester then I did in those 2 years. He's a great lecturer and super approachable, although he does stop frequently during class to make jokes which can throw your focus off sometimes. I would still highly recommend taking him though.",4
An amazing instructor who truly makes an effort to take an interest in his students' learning and lives. The content is reviewed multiple times in class and then applied to enjoyable projects so you learn the content well. Exams are extremely manageable with multiple practice tests to work from. I plan to take any class that I can with him in the future.,4
"If you like a professor who makes a lot of jokes and talks with the students in lecture a lot, you'll probably like Nelson. He's funny and nice, but I found it pretty annoying how he'd stop lecture every five minutes to talk about something unrelated or tell us to talk to our neighbors. I stopped going to lecture and just used the slides he posts because the material isn't difficult. I had no Java experience but this class was pretty easy. The projects aren't too bad, just start them kinda early and make sure you know when they're due (they sometimes have smaller parts due earlier than the rest of the project) so that doesn't catch you by surprise. The exams are harder imo, but they're usually pretty similar to the practice exams he gives you.
Also super lax about extensions for projects and exams, I got extensions for two projects and two exams.",3
Amazing professor. Really cares about his students and wants them to do well. He makes lectures really funny while simultaneously teaching the material. His teaching style definitely doesn't work for everyone but I learned a lot from him.,4
"probably one of the most genuine professors at the school, and the most genuine teacher ive had in my entire academic career. he's simply a great character who just wants to see his students succeed, both in the class and outside of it. the class itself was really well organized, the projects were well explained, the TA's were helpful, and the tests were fair. the only slight downside i felt was that i think nelson isn't the best lecturer in terms of explaining his ideas, but the code examples he reviewed were always helpful and he records lectures anyway if you need to revisit a topic. nelson is also very understanding if you need extensions. great guy, well structured and fair class, theres not much more you could ask for. definitely recommend.",4
I honestly think that these reviews hype him up a little too much. He is actually a pretty annoying lecturer as he never stays on topic and he might talk about random stuff for 60% of the class and would only teach the other 40%. He is too unfocused and it makes lectures so hard to go to. But his exams and quizzes are pretty fair.,1
"Nelson made this class easy and enjoyable for me. I had an AMAZING semester this Fall and I truly appreciate all the things Nelson has done for us. He has made a work environment where everyone belongs and there are a lot of great TAs and review sessions and practice material for everything so you will eventually learn everything super easily! His classes and sessions are very well structured and also the fact that he takes into consideration everything. So when it's a peak of a semester he wouldn't bother you with gaining out a hard exam or stressing you with taking quizzes. And also the projects he gives are not always hard with no purpose. He makes some projects easy to help you learn the course material and I would say don't worry about them if you have learned the course material well. If you are unable to do the projects don't panic and go look for answers online or from your friend because that won't help you in the exam. Try understanding where you are going wrong and then try to learn it and do it yourself.  When you feel like you have learned then that's it! You know that subject very well since it's very similar to what you'll see in exams and honestly exams are way easier than projects so if you write them yourself and know projects well you know everything!
Also based on the difficulty of the projects some of them were only based on the public test or release test results and there were no secret tests or style or student test regulations on them. I think it helped a lot and was absolutely very considerable of Nelson!
He also has an amazing personality and I really enjoy learning from his experiences and trying them! He is one of the BEST PROFESSORS I HAVE EVER HAD !!!!!",4
"This class was phenomenal! Genuinely the most enjoyable CMSC course you can take at UMD. Projects are very manageable, exams are quite easy if you run through study guides, and you do not have to attend class at all! If you make an effort to soak in the course material, you will learn a ton of applicable skills and it's an easy resume booster, you learn a lot of tools in such a short time. (I suggest working on the final project alone or doing something grand so you can put it on your resume, I did a personal portfolio as my final)",4
"Nelson is a great professor. I like how he keeps the class engaged by telling jokes throughout his lecture. I also like how he gives out practice exams that prepare us well for all of the exams in the class. He's also pretty receptive when it comes to extenuating circumstances, and you will not have a hard time getting extensions. However, if you are a rising freshman and have NEVER CODED BEFORE, my suggestion would be to at least learn a bit of Java before going into this class during the summer or winter break depending on when your next semester starts. Even learning the very basics of Java before starting the class can make your life much easier down the line. If your goal in the class is to get an A or A+, I would strongly suggest doing this.",4
"Nelson is a great professor. Cracks lots of jokes during lectures and keeps it casual but still teaches and explains the concepts well. Gives you a little breaks during the lecture to ask questions or talk to your seatmates. All the lectures and discussions are recorded (and there's no graded work during discussions) so you don't even have to go to class if you feel like you have a solid enough grasp on the concepts through watching the recordings, and TAs are almost always holding office hours either virtually or in person if you do need extra help. Projects near the end of the semester came with a LOT of direction -- like, 400 slide powerpoints with exactly what the projects expected to see, which can be overwhelming at first but they help a lot. Projects are fair and exams are too. The only downside is Nelson likes to tease his students and call them out randomly during lecture, noticing if they've changed seats since last lecture or maybe they're talking or doing something else instead of paying attention, which is funny if you never get called on because he plays it off lightheartedly as a joke each time, but stressful if you have anxiety about things like that. Easily avoided if you just watch the recordings or don't make yourself stand out during lecture though.",4
"Overall, Nelson is a great professor that is willing to help his students. It is also fairly easy to get extensions on projects if you have a valid excuse or reschedule an exam or quiz if you were absent. Nelson also gives out plenty of practice exams and quizzes to help you prepare for the real exams/quizzes. However, for those with NO CODING EXPERIENCE who signed up for this course who want to recieve an A, I would suggest learning the basics of Java before the class starts in order to feel less stressed in the class. Also, even if you believe that the project will be light, start doing the project ASAP to alleviate stress.",4
"incredibly understanding lecturer who cares about his students, but the problem is that his lectures just feel like a complete waste of time. it's pretty much 40% lecture, 50% him cracking jokes, 10% other downtime, and while he is incredibly funny, it does get old by the end of the semester.

other helpful notes:
-final was incredibly easy
-projects are very easy to follow, accompanied with PDFs that basically hold your hand the whole way
-a lot of his TAs tend to be bad for whatever reason; you do not need to attend discussions anyway
-lectures are very digestible in the recorded format because you can skip through all the wasted time. albeit, you may find it easier learning some (not all) concepts yourself

I'm giving 4 stars but think of this as a 3.5/5",3
"Definitely my favorite professor from my first semester! Personality-wise, he's great -- Nelson is kind, has a sense of humor, does his best to answer questions, and clearly cares about his students. Lectures and discussions are recorded, and attendance is optional. He's always happy to talk in office hours and before/after lectures. The projects are generally not that challenging, and the instructions are always clear. The exams are fair; they all come with a ton of practice material; do a few past exams and you'll be just fine. All in all, not a tough professor and he's very responsive to student concerns. My TA was ass, but he generally hires good ones.

As for actually learning: the slides and coding examples he gives are great and basically all you need to understand the content and succeed. And if that isn't enough, he links you to a lot of other resources in the class website. However, keep in mind that in his lectures, he spends a lot of time just goofing around and cracking jokes. An example of this is when he scrolled through memes in Piazza for like 20 minutes one time. To be honest, those were the only times I actually paid attention, so I can't really speak on his lecturing ability lmao

Bottom line - when people register, his sections fill up first for a reason.",4
"I took CMSC335: Introduction to Javascript with Nelson over Fall 2023 as a CS elective.

You MUST take this course. It is actually useful and sometimes even fun. Nelson is of course, classic Nelson.

Please also take this course alongside TWO other CS classes because the workload for this course is negligible. It is easily balanced on top of taking CMSC330 and CMSC351, for example.

Records lectures, nobody shows up to class, I personally never watched the lectures but I did fine.

Nelson was terrible for CMSC131 (kind of expected because he does not like the subject so much and finds it boring, something to ""just pay the bills"") but he was great for CMSC216 and CMSC335 (both of which he likes), I cannot recommend him enough.",4
Very understanding professor and gives practice exams. I slacked off but if you work hard enough then it is an easy A. Def recommend him. Hes very funny and his lectures are engaging.,4
Love this guy! Nelson = GOAT,4
Super nice professor who's very fair in his exams and projects. He's also hilarious and makes lectures entertaining.,4
Nelson is as awesome as always. Take this course over all the other electives. You actually learn a good amount and become competent in website building at the end.,4
"Nelson is a very nice guy, and just as everyone else said at times he is genuinely entertaining. Unfortunately this is basically where the pros end. I have to say Nelson as a teacher/lecturer is very poor. He constantly goes on tangents where he will start shit with someone in the class (usually jokingly), or explain how he has ""Nothing but respect for nurses"" for over 5 minutes (this is a real anecdote). Nelson will also explain things using superficial analogies, like stating that the ""new"" keyword is like a nurse, which is fine as a sort of mnemonic, but the issue is he never actually explains how many Java things actually function beyond that. After about the third week I didn't attend any more lectures and strictly watched lecture videos recorded by Pedram, another professor who co-taught this course with him. I have to say, Pedram did a much better job explaining things in detail and I found his lectures much more informative. Besides that basically all projects, quizzes, and exams were extremely fair in the class, and the only possible issue if you understand the subject is the time constraint on the exams. I think overall you should only take Nelson over Pedram if you really understand the material well and want to be entertained in his class. If you don't know anything about programming, and want to seriously understand the material, I really think you should start with Pedram, as he will give you a much better foundation in the information.",1
"Nelson is a friendly professor for sure. He recorded lectures and posted slides so in-person lectures were optional. Midterms are fairly easy, and you can easy earn a A/B by practicing the old exams. The projects are easy as well. I'd definitely recommend it for students who want to learn web development.",4
"Nelson is simply incredible. He is very chill, kind, and funny, all while being a great instructor. His exams (very fair), projects, and lectures are the best!",4
Chill and funny professor that is very on top of things and regularly posts announcements / updates on piazza. He tends to make a lot of jokes and keep the lectures light-hearted so if you are struggling his lectures may distract you. Other than that I found that the TAs were very active on piazza so you could always posts questions there or go to their office hours.,4
"The class is easy and Nelson is a great lecturer, he makes it very fun. However, you can't talk in class or he will call you out so if you want to do that then just watch his lecture videos.",3
"So first off I have to say, Nelson is a genuinely funny and kind and caring person. He is very understanding of your circumstances and is ready to give you a make up or extension whenever you need it without asking for much proof or reason. I was personally super excited to have him for 216 since it has been a while since he taught the course in a normal fall/spring semester. I have realized I made a big mistake of taking him when I realized how his class is all over the place and gets way overly distracted. I appreciate the jokes, but it gets to be too much when I am just trying to learn the content. Like I genuinely haven't ever learned anything from his lectures whenever I go to them. I only learn from watching his summer lectures, in which he explains things better and more seriously. He expects us to watch videos from his lectures back in the summer, and then expects us to come into class somewhat knowing the material and lectures are more like a review session, which I really don't like, because I will sit in lecture for 75 minutes unable to concentrate because he will either talk about something I have no idea about, or go on a tangent about love lives idk. Like personally I do not have the time to watch entire lectures from previous semesters on top of lectures we have in person with all my other classes. Now let me get into the real reason why he's only getting 2 stars....HIS PROJECTS. Oh...my...god, the descriptions are so bad and confusing, and his third project genuinely made me want to cry. Not only does he assign projects, he also assigns exercises, which are like mini projects every week. So we generally have an exercise and a whole project in the same week. And the projects aren't even cool creative projects, they are just plain way too complicated not well described projects. I had heard that Yoon has similar projects to nelson which goes to show how awful they are. People say his main selling point is how easy his exams are, and while so far they weren't bad, they didn't feel easy enough for me to justify all of the other flaws. Please do yourself a favor and take Kauffman for 216.",1
"His class is extremity disorganized and a lacks clarity regarding exam content. Despite the absence of guidance on exam topics and the withholding of practice exams, students are left to navigate a frustrating academic experience devoid of support. For exam 1, the main coding question had content from Exam 3. He misguided all of his students.",0
"I agree with everything the review below said. Lectures are disorganized, often over half jokes or random tangents (istg he normally covers like 20 min or less from his published videos in one 1hr 15 lecture). I moved him from 2 to 3 stars though since 1) I feel like personally when he does explain things/watching his videos, it does make a lot of sense, 2) exams aren’t necessarily *easy* but you can do quite well on them after practice exams that he publishes since he pretty much copies the question then changes the names, and 3) the projects do suck but I don’t feel like *quite* as bad as the below review made them out to be. (I spent about 6 hours avg including office hour time for a week and a half project)",2
"Overall, Nelson is an incredible teacher. He knows what he is talking about, and is very forgiving when it comes to extensions. He tells you there is no such thing as a ""dumb question"" in his class, and will help you if you advocate for yourself (we got 80 release tokens on the most recent exercise). The one warning I have is that you should be prepared to do a great deal of work out of class. He posts the lecture slides and videos about a week in advance, and asks you to watch the videos and look over the slides before arriving in class. That being said, he records his lectures, so there is no issue with skipping.",4
"This man is the GOAT. He is the best CS Professor at UMD. He tries his absolute hardest to make sure that you pass his class. The projects are kind of hard and the TAs are harsh on style but other than that this was the best experience I have had with a CS course. Nelson's lectures are entertaining but he also records them so no need to show up for lectures. Before exams, he posts all of his previous exams, and the exams are exactly like his previous exams. If you know how to do the previous exams you will do fine on the actual exam. The topics in 216 are hard but Nelson does such a great job. Try your hardest to take at least one course with this man.",4
"Had 133 with Nelson. 133 is basically the same as 131 but with a smaller class (around 20 people) which was helpful for questions. At the beginning of the semester you start somewhat ahead (skip intro stuff like what classes, fields, methods are), and you may be one project ahead than 131,  but in the end you take the same exams. We took the same exact exams, in the same exam rooms as 131 with all the other 131 students but they just direct you to hand your exam to a specific TA at the end. 
Worth it to take 133 just for the smaller class size, definitely take it if you got a 4 on AP CS A",4
"Nelson is very fun professor. He makes lectures entertaining which is good, but it is also his downfall in teaching. He likes to ramble a lot so we will be behind on content by the end of class. One lecture is about 25% actual learning and the 75% him making jokes and telling stories. I appreciate that he tries to make lectures fun, but in the end you have to teach yourself everything. Additionally, if he does not get through a topic during class he will post videos that you need to watch. He will sometimes go over the material covered in the videos, but barely. 
His projects are fairly easy and if you ask him for more release tokens he will give it to you. His exams are also fair and he give A LOT of practice which is really good. 
Something that I did not like in his class was that he would call people out for either being on their phone or simply leaving to go to the bathroom. It made the lectures very uncomfortable to attend. Every time I attended lecture I was scared that I was going to get called out (even though I wasn't doing anything wrong) which made me dread going to lecture.",1
"Nelson is a great professor and makes 216 very straightforward. First and foremost, his lectures are a waste of time. Most of what he says is funny and not really helpful but most of the time in lecture he just goes through examples and explains them. If you don't want to go to class, don't. I went to maybe 5 this semester and have a 94 currently. His slides are straightforward and the amount of practice material he provides for exams is unheard of. Most exams he gives at least 5 previous exams, not only that, his exams are very similar to the provided practices. There aren't curveball questions but that doesn't mean his exams are extremely easy. If you complete like 3 or 4 practice exams you should be set though. One issue I have with Nelson is his project descriptions, they can be veryyyyy vague at times and can lead you to implement something completely useless because of a single word in his description. However, he makes up for this with responsive TAs and Piazza. Most of the mistakes I made through his descriptions were because of my lack of thoroughness; be sure to read it all the way through before you start.

TLDR: Funny guy, useless lectures, very self-studiable content, easy A if you put in the work, better than most other 216 profs",4
"He is a genuinely funny guy, the class is like a standup comedy session. On the other hand, going to lectures isn't the most useful for learning course content. Despite this, his exams are quite easy and people generally do well if you review the practice exams one or two days before. He also likes to drop life lessons on us which is more enjoyable than assembly ! Also pretty understanding for extensions and posts plenty of lecture videos, in which he is more serious than IRL lectures, if you actually like learning.He is the cornerstone of UMD cs. you should take him for the experience :D",3
Terribly organized class. You learn nothing. Not fun.,0
"I was genuinely so excited to take this course with Nelson, after hearing so many positive things about him. Man I was so dissapointed. I could not really sit through an entire lecture of his, he gets too distracted and his lecturing style feels kind of disorganized. I learn best by handwriting notes but his lectures make it nearly impossible to handwrite any notes, since it's mainly him going through code and running it. He also expects us to watch past semester lecture recordings prior to class, which I frankly do not have time for. I have specified lecture time for the purpose of learning, not reviewing something I already watched. I also HATED the projects he gave us!! They were described in such an awful way and were frustrating in that very important details would be written in small font after a long listed bullet points. The instructions were not straightforward at all and especially the assembly project was so insane. A lot of people were caught cheating on the assembly project because of how insanely difficult it was, and I can't blame them for desperately finding the code for it, because from what we learned from him, the project was way too advanced for that. I found out that nelson and yoon share similar projects. No wonder they were so awful. People say his exams are easy and make up for everything else. They really weren't easy, you still needed to study pretty hard, but they were FAIR exams. But they in no way ""Make Up"" for every other flow. While nelson is a genuinely nice person and is very accomodating to extensions and makeups, I would say definitely take Christopher Kauffman.",0
"You should either attend lectures or watch recordings if you want to learn. It is actually a pretty useful class. Youll learn a lot about web development. I was taking 20 credits so I barely focused on this class. I just took it for some filler cs in my schedule. If you try even a little bit, you can easily get an A. Exams are basically the same as sample exams, just make sure you review and actually understand everything on the sample exam. The projects are pretty easy as well. There is no final exam, just a final group project.",4
"TLDR: Really nice person, what you think of him as a teacher depends on how you like your lectures taught

Nelson's a really nice person overall. He's a chill and funny (sometimes) guy and genuinely cares about his students. Unfortunately, his goofiness bleeds into lectures a lot and often it makes lectures more unproductive than it should be. A joke here and there during an long lecture is welcome, but he consistently gets sidetracked with random shenanigans. There have been times where he stopped the entire lecture to call someone out for yawning and then starting a bit about getting them coffee. He also calls out anyone who looks like they're not taking notes/coding on their devices and stops class to ask them what they're watching.

If you like having this type of humor in lecture (which some people do since most people went to lectures even though it was recorded), then Nelson's perfect. Otherwise, see who the alternative professors are.",2
"His exam materials are all included in his bullet points for exam topics, which I thought was fair. The class was fun and chill, and projects were fair and easy. He also removed the last project just so we could have more time to do the final project/study.",4
"I thought Nelson was great for 216. His exams are the same as the practice ones he provides. While he gets frequently distracted during lectures, he provided lectures from previous semesters where he wasn't distracted, and I found them really helpful. No pop quizzes during discussion! The projects were tough, but the projects are tough for 216 no matter who you take.",4
"Liked this class because I really learned a lot stuff from it. His exam materials were all included in his bullet points for exam topics, which I thought was fair. Project were fun and easy as well, and the final project was a very interesting one to me personally. Nelson, overall, is a pretty good lecturer, he is very funny, kind, and he cares about his students a lot. I recommend everyone take this class.",4
"super chill course, especially for senior year :) only downsides sometimes were exams having coding content from other exams (ex. exam1 having the content from previous exam2s, exam2 having content from previous exam3s), but all the topics on exams were always outlined and stuff so it was fair in that regard. not bad at all and would 100% recommend!",4
"I’m a bit conflicted about what exact rating I should leave here, as having Nelson as my professor was a pretty conflicting experience. Nelson is genuinely a really funny lecturer and cracks a lot of jokes to keep the class lighthearted, but when you actually want to focus in class, it starts to become pretty distracting and honestly sometimes even frustrating. Constantly in the middle of lecturing he’ll go on long unrelated tangents, or single out and start talking to random students in the auditorium, which can be irritating when you want to learn. Especially coming straight out of Fawzi’s 50-minute fast-paced no-laptops non-recorded lectures for 132 (which all helped me focus), staying focused in Nelson’s class was a lost cause. He ended up also posting his old pre-recorded lectures that had none of these tangents on Panopto, and they were what I (and a lot of people in this class) primarily learned the material from. 
That being said, he really is a nice guy, and he does like getting to know his students. If you need an extension or a make-up, he’ll absolutely give it to you without much need for proof which really helped me out a couple times when I needed it. And, for each midterm, he provides you with all of the previous exams (and their answer keys) from the previous semesters, which make the actual exams super easy since they’re really similar.
I’d say Kauffman is probably the better 216 professor (if that’s the choice you’re making), but even though Nelson’s lectures were often disorganized, it was still a pretty fun and easy time.",3
"Not the best teacher,he gave sample papers for exam 1 and asked major coding question(near 70 points) from other exam.Just goes through code examples,very hard to understand his teaching plus not very funny jokes during class.",0
"He was terrible for 131,just skims through all his code examples without much explanation",0
"Great professor and great personality. His lectures are extremely engaging and I can confidently say that you will most likely laugh at least once in every lecture. We only had a single quiz (worth 4%) the entire semester. The quiz was also a guaranteed 100% as all you needed to know was how to use a few debugging tools. We had 3 midterms and all were extremely easy as they were pretty similar to the practice exams that he gave. His projects are not too difficult, however you will find that they might take awhile to complete (especially the assembly project). My only complaint is that sometimes projects and exercises have 2 deadlines, so you have to fulfill the first deadline by passing the first few public tests. Overall though, best 216 professor you can choose.",4
"nelson's style of teaching for 216 is definitely a bit of a hit or miss; his in-person lectures are fairly disorganized and mostly him getting distracted every two minutes, but his online videos from other the summer are a lot more concise and informative. his projects are definitely tough and his descriptions are a little all over the place, but i don't think they're unreasonable -- you just need to start early and go to ta office hours. the only thing is that he also assigns exercises, which are like mini-projects meant to introduce a topic, and the window for exercises and projects overlap pretty heavily so if you procrastinate, it can become very stressful. his exams are generally very similar to all of the practice exams he gave, which means they were generally straightforward if you studied. all in all, i'd say nelson's class is one where you have to be very proactive in (making sure to start projects and exercises early, and making sure to study his old exams thoroughly), but i personally found it to be a really fun and enjoyable class where i definitely learned a lot",3
"Nelson Definitely Made 216 a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. The class is grade is comprised of 36% Project Grade, 4% Quizzes, and 46% Exams, and 14% Final Exam. Originally I thought the Exams were going to be the most difficult part of the course, but the averages on them were all 90% or above if I recall correctly. The projects took a long time usually but doable in like 3 days, I always made sure to start them early and always ended with at least 2 days of extra time before the project was due. The lectures themselves are usually fun but honestly if you want to learn the content just watch the past semester video he posts, cause in lecture it felt like we went through like 40 minutes worth of content in a 75 minute lecture.   If you're taking CMSC216 with Nelson, focus a lot on the projects, which if you truly understand them, will prepare you quite well for the coding questions (which is usually most of the points on the exam), this is especially true for the assembly project. Then a week before the exam start doing 1-3 past exams (which he gives you). If you do this you will probably get at least a 95 on each exam. 
Overall, my gripes with the class are that the lectures sometimes had a bit too many side tangents which made them fun, but always made it feel like we were behind on content.",3
"Nelson is a pretty good professor and a nice guy. He likes to joke around in lectures and can waste a lot of time when he gets distracted, but he (usually) gets through the content he needs to cover and will always provide recordings to cover what he doesn't get to in lecture. Some people find him getting off-topic distracting, but it actually helped me pay attention since I also get distracted often and his jokes are a nice brain break. Nelson's an active poster on the course Piazza and is extremely transparent about things like grading and exam content. 

Exams are extremely reasonable and Nelson provides plenty of practice materials and is extremely clear on what they will cover. Projects/exercises aren't unreasonable. For reference, I found the projects to be less convoluted than projects from Fawzi's CMSC 132, but the instructions are more confusing and unclear. Ultimately they aren't terribly difficult, just start early and ask him clarifying questions if you get confused.",4
"Nelson is a good teacher and very funny. he cares about the content a lot. This class is very fun and very useful for getting started with JavaScript and web development. Would definitely recommend. That being said, exam 1 was kind of a mess because it was not like the sample exams even though he said it would be. The rest of the exams and projects were straightforward. Definitely take him and this class, just expect to put some work into it if you want an A.",4
"This class was chill but it’s pretty useless. It’s missing key elements that are useful in modern web development such as typescript, react, and relational databases. The class material is dated to like 2015 at best. Expected much more for the $$$ we are paying in tuition.",1
"Love Nelson, makes you feel welcomed even in a room of 300 students. His explanations and examples are adaptive and dynamic. He's great!",4
"To echo my other review of Nelson, he makes you feel welcomed in a room of hundreds. The course content of 132 is so so important as principles of CS, and he instructs in an engaging fashion. Start your projects early, as always ;)",4
It was a fine class. Content is not difficult but his exams can be tricky. The good thing is his exams are similar to practice (structure wise). I think some of the point distributions were unfair though. The big change I noticed from his other classes and this is the powerpoints are very bland. There wasn't really enough content on them to answer questions. So it forces you to watch the lectures or go to class (obviously most choose to watch lectures). That being said I think if you learn content from the practices and project you can set yourself up for at least a decent grade.,3
Amazing. He is so nice and understanding and I built a really strong foundation in Java in his class. This is a great intro class where you'll learn a lot but won't feel overwhelmed.,4
Lowkey kind of hard and fast pace but Nelson is very kind and will offers a lot of support and help. Would definitely reccommend taking this over the summer if you have a lot going on during the school year. I also would not reccommend doing 216 and 250 together. Take 216 over the summer if you can.,3
CMSC216 with this professor was easy not hard at all,4
"In terms of difficulty, Nelson's 216 is a joke. Provides 10+ years of practice exams and all midterms are basically recycled, to the point where content on these exams honestly felt unfairly easy. 
Projects felt pretty fair, as long as you space your work out there shouldn't really be a problem.
My biggest problem with Nelson was his lectures, it felt like he often got sidetracked and I stopped going in person after a week because I felt like I was getting nothing out of class. What helped a lot was his past recorded videos, these are much more concise and cut out all of the tangents from his in person lectures.",2
"Quite literally the goat in almost every way possible. I had a FAR easier time in this class compared to Herman's 132 (not that Herman is bad, I personally love him but he definitely runs a tough class.) Provides far more exam practice then you will ever need and the content is very easy to manage, especially if you take it in the summer like I did. Exam 3 was almost the exact same as the practice given, so as long as you spend 5 or so hours practicing per exam you should do good. He's also incredibly nice and approachable, and apart from sometimes getting sidetracked in lectures there really isn't anything bad I can say about him.",4
"Since I already had experience with web programming, this was one of the easiest CS classes I've ever taken. Nelson doesn't require attendance, so I showed up only for the midterms. He provides many resources to use when studying so you're never unprepared. One neat thing about the final project is it's up to you to design and implement it.",4
"I think Nelson is hands-down the best introductory computer-science teacher in the department. He does a great job at welcoming people, motivating people, making the class engaging with his students, cares for each and every student above and beyond, etc. He is very open to receiving feedback and input into how he runs the class. Very honorable as well, as he doesn't tolerate cheating and gives students the grade they deserve in the class, regardless of his opinion of a certain student. His tests are extremely fair and what he covers in lecture will be on the tests. Class is extremely relatable to the tests and he is super knowledgeable about programming and the real world of computer science. He promotes fairness, equality, and hard work while going out of his way to help people form groups within and outside of the class, so people feel connected in a world of disconnected computer-scientists. 100% Take him if you get the chance.",4
"I took Nelson over the summer of 2024, and to be honest, you'll pass if you study his previous exams and you submit your projects on time. You can learn off the slides but personally I didn't get much help from them. A lenient grader (except the final)  and he's very anal about academic integrity. If you're having trouble balancing things or struggling with grades, talk to him, he's very understanding. Also he has a fun personally so he likes to joke and laugh a lot. If you're going to take 216, take it with Nelson.",4
"didnt go to a single lecture, didnt watch a single recording, spammed the practice exam 2 days before each exam, got a B.

My only complaint is that the final didn't have a practice and also the assembly stuff was kinda annoying. not even any real complaints",4
Great teacher that only wants the best for his students. Content can be tricky but a lot of his resources can help you succeed. Just make sure you do well throughout the class as his final can be tricky. Overall great teacher,4
"Nelson is knowledgeable and teaches the material decently but he is unprofessional. He often distracts from the material and embarrasses students, like calling out a student for her insulin pump beeping. He shouldn't have to make jokes at the expense of a student to engage his class because not every student is comfortable being put on blast in front of the whole class. This behavior discourages students from coming to class and creates an uncomfortable environment for those that he picks on and students that have to watch. He does grade fairly and records lectures which is nice. He seems to care about students a lot but continues to act rudely towards them.",1
"Super nice guy, but spends about 1/3 of lecture time going on tangents or joking with students. I just stopped going to class after the first week (he posts recordings) and watched the recordings on 1.5x. Exams were almost always copy pasted from one of the previous exams (which he gives you) and felt absurdly easy compared to other classes I've taken. Projects were also very fair, just start early and the workload isn't bad. I would highly recommend taking Nelson for 216 if you are able.",4
"Lectures are hard to pay attention to since he keeps going on tangents, but his practice exams are nearly the same as the actual exam. Super easy to get high scores for exams so they aren't stressful. Projects were annoying, though, until I figured out that I could just go to office hours whenever I wanted and the TA's would help me debug my code. That made projects a lot easier and less stressful. This class is pretty easy once you figure out the strategy (go to office hours as much as possible and do practice exams before every test). The final was difficult though, but it didn't matter since my score was already so high from projects and tests. Easy teacher, good life.",4
"I don't really understand all the hype around Nelson; he comes across as a condescending teacher. For 335, the first midterm felt like a chore, requiring you to memorize a bunch of random information. The only effective way to prepare was by studying previous midterms. For fall 2024, our midterms were nearly identical to those from the previous spring, but they’re always subject to change—spring 2024's midterm, for example, wasn’t like fall 2023's. Our semester got lucky with similar midterms, but overall, you don’t learn much in this class.

I was in the 8 AM section, and while I didn’t mind the early timing, Nelson's lectures were quite boring. He often makes jokes and gets off-topic, which isn’t what I want to deal with at 8 AM. It feels like he doesn’t fully understand the material he's teaching. When asked for specifics, he often can’t provide clear answers. If something in his code doesn’t work, he doesn’t seem to know why.

I already knew the basics of HTML and CSS but wanted to learn more about JavaScript and MongoDB. Unfortunately, I was disappointed—Nelson simply gave us the code for those topics without explaining how the systems work. The final exam was super easy and almost identical to Project 5. You could literally reword that project and still get full points on the final.

The TAs are often PhD or master’s students, and they’re difficult to work with. They don’t provide helpful answers most of the time. This class is definitely worth taking if you’re in it for the grade, but it has its downsides. For example, the midterms aren’t given during class; instead, they’re held at 6:30 PM in a different lecture hall. While I understand Nelson’s intent to prevent one section from sharing answers with another, this setup is inconvenient. I would much prefer taking the midterms during class.

Overall, I think 335 needs to be restructured. It feels outdated and poorly designed. We had to learn things from JavaScript ES5, which is deprecated—why bother teaching it? I wish they’d reduce the focus on CSS and introduce more relevant topics, like React, into the projects. A more modern framework would make this course much more worthwhile.",2
"Nelson is so goated, he makes class funny. You can learn the concepts yourself while watching lecture videos but I like going to class cause the vibes were good and made great friends. DO THE PROJECTS, if not it'll become a habit. Exams are like practice so do them!",4
"Not as easy as I would've thought, but still not very difficult. In terms of difficulty, the projects are easier than his 216 class, and instead of a final you get an easy final project, but the exams are about the same difficulty. Still do not slack off with the projects and make sure you study the past exams and focus on the most recent one",4
"Probably the easiest 300/400 level course in the CS department. If you put effort in not falling behind and starting the projects early, you will succeed. Nelson is great at explaining concepts when he’s not joking around. My one complaint is that I wish he didn’t joke around as much, but that wasn’t a big deal. I just watched the lecture recordings since you can skip around and speed up the vids. Great prof for an easy and useful class.",4
"nelson markets the class as ""the easiest a you'll ever get in cs"", and he isn't wrong per se. the projects are fairly straightforward (and the majority of the code for them can be found scattered across his lecture examples), although i know some students had issues with mongodb, which was in the last project so i'd definitely at least set up your projects early to troubleshoot potential issues. the exams for fall 2024 were also very similar to spring 2024, although spring 2024 was completely different from fall 2023, so take that how you will. honestly, this class is pretty chill if you're just looking for an upper level cs course, but is also very basic in what it covers (html, css, js, node, express, mongodb). nelson himself is the goat however so 5 stars",4
"Truly a great class! Nelson's expectations are always fair and clear. Projects are fun and straightforward as long as you know the content from the lecture. The lectures are recorded, and attendance is not mandatory. The TAs were very active on Piazza and answered all questions promptly.

One thing to note is that he made exams harder this semester. You can still get A’s on all of them if you follow the study guide Nelson posts before every exam. On the downside, sometimes, he explains topics on a very superficial level or goes on tangents, making it harder to understand content.

Overall, I highly recommend CMSC335 with Nelson, as it is a fun, manageable class that teaches you really useful content.",4
"As other reviews had stated, pretty good on the workload and the way the exams are similar, no curveballs. The projects all have bread crumbs so it's 80 percent copy and paste and 20 percent work. If anything his TAs are pretty decent and care easy to reach.",4
"Pretty great class!! Nelson gives you all the materials to set you up for success tbh. I love how the final project is really up to you as you create your own application based on the skills you learn, which is super applicable. I wish react was incorporated into the class more, but he discusses it at the very end after exam 3 (not as motivating!). Otherwise, very easy A.",4
"This class is honestly a joke. You really don’t need to go to lecture at all because you can teach yourself everything. Each project took me maybe 2–3 hours max, and for the exams, you just need to study the day before. And by “study,” I mean memorize the format of the previous exams.

I'm giving Nelson a 3 because he doesn’t seem very invested in what he’s teaching and tends to go off-topic a lot (another reason I skipped lectures. I didn’t feel like I learned much from them).

I took this class alongside 330 and 351, and it wasn’t too much work overall.",2
"I also took 216 with Nelson and have never really been a fan of his teaching style. I just find it easy to become disengaged with how often he goes off topic. However, he's an extremely kind professor who cares a lot about his students. This class in specific is extremely easy to get an A in as long as you make sure you follow the instructions for all projects and set aside a day or 2 to ""study"" for the exams (just memorize the format). I attended a few lectures at the beginning of the semester but decided it wasn't necessary and was still able to get an A pretty easily. I'm personally not that interested in web dev but I did want to learn a basic overview and this class provided just that. Overall, I would recommend this class if you're interested in web dev or simply looking for an easy A.",4
"If you want an easy grade without really learning anything, take Nelson. He tries to be funny, but that's not what I came to school for. I wish I had taken 216 with somebody who actually cares more about teaching than just being popular. I got an A, but I don't really feel prepared for upper level courses that might depend on 216.",0
"taking the summer session currently, and it's making me want to kill myself! lectures are ramble-y, examples are far too busy, and the way we're being taught assembly (ie reading off slides verbatim) is absurd. exams and earlier projects were light but holy shit is this class miserable currently",1
Super nice professor but I'm not sure if I really learned anything because his exams were practice test simulators. Projects aren't too bad tho! He's also very entertaining to watch.,2
Great guy,4
"impeccable hair, 10/10 teacher",4
"Solid professor, super nice. Couple times had some confusing examples and lectures but super understanding with student concerns",4
"Cliff teaches really well. He's young and relatable, his lectures are organized, and he does a great job of answering questions and clarifying on points of confusion. He seems like a nice person too. My only qualm would be with the class itself, which was that the homeworks often covered really complicated or difficult applications of what was covered during the lectures, especially towards the end of the semester.",4
"First of all, his hair is amazing. Second, he is a really nice guy and he wants you to succeed. The co-taught with Justin WG this semester, and the exams were reasonable. Some of the homeworks were pretty difficult, but they are not impossible if you utilize office hours. I would recommend him!",4
Cliff is amazing. 250 itself is hard but he made it as easy as possible to understand the material. 10/10 hair and 10/10 teaching.,4
"Lectures get a bit confusing at times, but he answers questions clearly. He’s also very understanding and really wants everyone to succeed. Would take this class again if he were teaching it, if the material itself wasn’t so confusing at the end o_o",4
Great hair and a good lecturer who likes legos.,4
"He does not read his emails, TAs are unresponsive. Assignments take forever to get graded and graded incorrectly a decent amount of times. Not great.",1
He does not respond to emails. TAs are as unresponsive as him. They mess up grading and answer keys.,1
"Hard HWS but can do with friends. Generous to students about quizzes and exams. Lectures start off slow, but speed up. Never got too fast tho.",4
"Not very engaging as a teacher but gets the job done. Handwriting isn't the best so sometimes it's hard to follow, and examples in class aren't nearly as hard as the homework/exam questions. Class is unorganized as a whole, as documents and solutions always seem to have some typo or mistake. TA's are not that helpful and sometimes can't answer certain questions. Grading is very poor, as graders often make mistakes when grading and it takes very long for assignments to be graded. Regrade requests aren't looked at for a long time as well. Cliff is an understanding and nice guy, who keeps the students' best interests in mind, but there are definitely many things that can be improved.",2
Very boring and unorganized teacher. Don't expect anything graded for weeks.,2
"In the Fall 2021 semester, Cliff Bakalian was the new instructor for CMSC250, and many of my friends who took him left with very positive impressions. Because of this, when I saw his name listed on Testudo for CMSC330 the following semester, I was very excited to sign up for his lecture section and learn more about the organization of programming languages. Unfortunately, I was left rather disappointed.

CMSC330 is a very content-heavy class - the sheer amount of information being packed into a single week is astounding. However, students have already taken or gotten credit for CMSC131, CMSC132, and CMSC216 by this point, so learning new material should not be a foreign experience. Sadly, Cliff's lecture style left something to be desired. He usually seemed to prioritize covering as many slides as possible as opposed to focusing on the fundamentals. For example, one week we had a PowerPoint nearly 70 slides long - Cliff blasted through as fast as he could, and many of the pertinent examples provided he would go ""I don't care about this,"" and skip straight past them. Consequently, by the time we got to more complicated topics, I was lost and confused as we didn't spend enough time on the fundamentals.

I stopped going to his lectures about a month into the semester and decided to watch Professor Van Horn's recordings instead - while he could be monotonous at times, he took much more care with the material, and besides, there are a great number of very helpful TAs both in in-person and online office hours, so I got by that way.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend taking CMSC330 with Cliff unless you can absorb lots of material very quickly. At least he responds to questions effectively.",1
"Cliff is a very understanding person, but he has very boring lectures, keeping me and others very disengaged. Handwriting is not good so it’s hard to follow, and when it comes to grading, there will either be a lot of mistakes or grades just won’t come out until a month after the assignment. ",1
"While I don't vibe with his lecturing style, Cliff is a very knowledgeable and nice professor! I had external issues this semester and was really scared to talk to him about it, but he didn't ask any questions and was extremely understanding-- more so than I thought any professor here would be. He obviously cares about the class content and students. He's new to teaching and has said he's constantly thinking of how to change the class for the better, so I think he'll only improve from here. If he's an option, definitely take him :) ",4
"Great guy, terrible teacher. Cliff cares about his students, but the structure of the class and lectures was god-awful. There was seemingly little communication between him and the TAs, leading to a lot of misunderstandings and extremely delayed grading. Lectures were either incredibly trivial and boring or very confusing. Lectures also often didn't prepare us fully for the homework or exams. The grading was super questionable for everything, and almost everyone I talked to in the class submitted multiple regrade requests throughout the semester. Mistakes on seemingly every homework assignment were only fixed several days after being released. I actually learned most of the content in Discussion thanks to my GOAT TA. Cliff bases his lectures and content off of Justin's notes, but often presents them in a more confusing manner. The previous positive reviews were from when he co-taught the course with Justin, so I guess it was drastically different than this semester, because the general consensus is that this class was a mess.",0
"Cliff doesn't know the material he is teaching and recommends us to use Justin's notes because he even confuses himself during lecture. He didn't post lectures until weeks after the material was covered in class and in those videos, usually posted after the homeworks were due for that material, he would correct himself about something he said during the in person lecture. He didn't hold his TAs to any standard and he was very behind in grading and we had to go into every quiz and exam without knowing the grades of the relevant work we turned in weeks prior. He told us at the start that he came from a philosophical background and not CS and it showed. He would trip up on his wording and sometimes would scrap half of the work he was writing because he was lost himself. I would try to avoid him in future years if he ends up teaching anything more than 250 because I can't deal with being taught by someone who acts like a student themselves and can't stay on top of their own responsibilities. I know this was his first semester teaching on his own but it was even worse than I thought it could have went.",1
"Cliff has good intentions but is far from being a good, or even an average instructor. This was his first semester teaching and the class has been a disaster. Mistakes on every assignment, weeks to grade, slow responses - overall a really frustrating experience. His class was the worst organized class I have ever taken.",1
"DO NOT TAKE CLIFF!!!!

Confuses himself in lectures, illegible handwriting, speedruns lecture slides in monotone, doesnt post lecture slides for weeks, takes 3 MONTHS to grade EACH homework, and once it is graded there are mistakes everywhere with autograding and TAs. The previous ratings were when he co-taught with Justin so he had high ratings, but now that he is on his own, he is beyond awful. Perhaps the worst class and lecturer I ever had. 

If you are fine with not having half your homework, quizzes, and exams graded when you take your final exam and are fine with a disorganized monotone speedrunning professor with illegible handwriting then take this course.",0
Don't take him. Period.,0
"Maybe the material just came quickly to me, but the organization of this class was a mess. I understand Cliff is young and stressed and new to teaching, but oh my

Took about 2 months to get an exam graded, multiple questions were messed up.

I am not joking when every single assignment/homework/quiz/exam he gave us had some sort of mistake on it. I have never seen a group of TA's who have cared less about what they're doing, and honestly, it was extremely insulting. Every single homework had an issue with grading, as well as quizzes and exams.

 I understand that this isn't Cliff's fault, but it felt like my future in CS was being determined by his TA's who must've had their eyes closed while grading any assignment. It honestly felt like the entire team gave up halfway through.

With all that being said - He understands what he's doing. My guess is that he just needs time - AND NEW TA'S.",1
Honestly has the potential to be a great teacher but is completely unorganized and seems like he doesn't care. Grades for assignments are not released until 2 months later which does not help you for exams or homework at all.,0
"Cliff's class is the most awfully organized class I have every taken. Nothing is posted on time: lectures, grades, etc. Good person, but highly overrated as an instructor because he co-taught with Justin. All of his content is recycled from Justin's material, and it doesn't even feel worth going to lecture. His practice exam for the final consists of a copy paste of the Exam 1 and Exam 2 practice exams, with like two additional questions, even when he stated that over half the final would be on stuff after Exam 1 and Exam 2. Probably because this was all the content available from Justin. It's overall a horrible experience to constantly be frustrated with nothing being graded properly, posted on time, having no idea what your grade is, and feeling like you aren't set up to succeed in the class. I would not recommend taking Cliff if there is a better alternative.",0
immaculate hair but terrible class management,0
"Great person, horrible teacher. Every single paper or lecture has has a mistake, even answer keys and en exam. Don’t expect to get scores back for anything until 2 months after you submitted it. Cliff doesn’t look at Piazza doesn’t post lecture videos until weeks after you need it. Terribly run class but I believe he has potential ti be great, just not anytime soon.",0
"Cliff is nice and understanding but his teaching style is very subpar. He's constantly unorganized and doesn't respond to emails. Although he records lectures to post online, he is constantly late and posts the material needed for homework on the day it's due. It seems he doesn't understand how to take responsibility and maybe that's because this is his first class he is teaching without help, but over the course of the semester, I started to realize that he continues to fall below normal standards.",0
"TLDR: Nice dude, poor teacher


Look I want to be fair. Cliff is a nice person and I feel like he understands what we go through. With that said I really felt hopeless at time during his class.

I didn't really understand these concepts until I started reading Justin's notes.
(I guess that's sort of my fault, if I had looked at the notes earlier maybe I would have done better)

His lectures honestly jumped around a lot. When showing us steps he would sort of pull out solution from thin air.
He didn't show us the intuition and the though process behind what he was doing. This lack of clear steps really frustrated me.

Grading wasn't great.
His examples in lecture don't go into enough details and so on exams and quiz's I would miss several points because of formatting or slightly different methods.
The grading was also inconsistent at times. 
Several regrade request were sent.
",1
"While there were a few snags this semester, Cliff clearly cares about the class and is doing his best for his first-time teaching independently. At most, the late turnaround on assignments and errors in grading were inconveniences, and did not impact my understanding of the class at all. His lecturing style worked for me, and I always felt set up to complete all the assignments just from just the lectures. Most of all, Cliff is simply the most compassionate and understanding professor I've ever had. People here put that in as an aside, but if some roadblock suddenly emerges mid-semester, you will be very glad to have Cliff instead of a more apathetic professor. Overall, I think it is only fair that we give Cliff the same level of compassion that he extends to us. Given that it's his first time alone and he's clearly trying his best, I'm willing to let a few things slide.",4
"Very disorganized class, grading was extremely poor, examples were convoluted, and it seemed that there was no consistent standard for how proofs should be written, as Cliff seemed to change his style at random between lectures. Would definitely recommend avoiding Cliff.",1
"Took him for CMSC250 his first semester teaching, and had a pretty decent experience. The class was mostly organized and he knew the content pretty well.

Unfortunately 330 this semester wasn't the same. While the class was organized well, cliffs lectures were very difficult to follow along with. He seemed to not be interested in the material, and would speed through content and wouldn't/struggled to break down complex topics. This was especially a problem when it came to Rust, which is pretty complex and we covered in the last 3 weeks of the semester. I went to almost all lectures this year, and for each I found myself feeling disengaged with the content. I found myself learning most of the content by carefully reading the lecture slides after the lecture was over, and looking at outside resources.

All in all cliff is a great guy and clearly cares about his students, but his lectures weren't up to what I was expecting for a CS course.",1
"Cliff skips over important material in lectures, paces poorly, and does not truly attempt to check for understanding among the class. When nobody raises their hand to answer his lecture quiz questions, it would suggest that few are following the material. The class was still not particularly difficult, considering that exams were online and very fair. Watching David Van Horn's lecture videos were also great for getting up to speed. Cliff's lectures, however, are inadequate for engaging with the important material in this class. TLDR; the TAs and Van Horn's videos carried me through this class; would not currently recommend Cliff",1
Lectures might be a bit boring but all of the content you need to know for the exams is explained pretty well. Quizzes and tests were online and open-note for us which made them very stress-free.,3
extremely cool and also based professor. do not listen to the other girls. he slays too hard.,4
"This class had the potential to be good. Cliff structured the course in a ""hybrid"" kind of way that was very understanding towards students—lectures were-in person but basically everything else was online and/or asynchronous. Homeworks were encouraged to be done collaboratively; quizzes and tests were open-note. Lectures are dull but not notably duller than any other 3-star CS professor I've had so far.

Incredibly poor organization, however. Slow and inconsistent grading. Takes off points for style yet the lecture examples—Cliff handwrites proofs and screen shares—are a mess. I stopped showing up to discussion because my TA didn't seem to care about the content, and because what we were told in discussion didn't always line up with what we were told in lecture and/or what was expected on graded assignments. The proof style guide was helpful but only for the first few units, and then it was no longer maintained.

Most of my learning in this course came from provided practice material, which was okay in the beginning but once we started getting to more word problems—proofs, statistics, combinatorics, etc.—hilariously poor quality. Hilarious because if someone just proofread the material once, 90% of the problems could be fixed. They're obviously copied and pasted from other sources—they'll be talking about pizzas one sentence and party hats the next, which isn't so bad until you try to check your work and they didn't even bother to change the answer key to match the new question at all. Answer keys are wrong or just plain irrelevant on a good chunk of the questions. Unclear phrasing and the questions can be interpreted many ways, which isn't great when they're expecting one solution. Ask three different people these questions and they're bound to interpret the question three different ways. I only grasped the combinatorics and statistics unit because of Justin's notes and through group studying in order to figure out what the question is really asking.",1
"Cliff's 250 this semester was quite an experience that could (and should) have been much smoother. As already mentioned, his biggest flaws are much mismanagement (having no work graded until 1 week before the final, including the second exam, very little explanation as to why points are taken off and what is expected, hardly responding to emails). A decent portion of my grade lost would be from assignments that I was not able to send or resend in time from not having a printer which stifled numerous questions on quizzes and exams. Additionally, there were some times when he muddled up material, or said things incorrectly and didn't follow a set standard that TAs may have graded. However, given that Cliff is a relatively new professor, and was handling 2 huge CS courses this semester, it seemed he did try to put a good deal of effort in both courses. In addition, the hybrid structure of in person lectures and exams/quizzes being online was weird to adapt to and caused numerous issues, which is not Cliff's fault particularly. He definitely has a chance to grow and despite the problems, he did an alright job handling the teaching/lecturing he needed to do this semester.",2
"Cliff is generally a great guy and a pretty solid professor. He's very approachable and definitely tries his best to make the class interactive though it can be difficult given the lack of participation sometimes. He showed examples in REPls like irb and utop and I came out of lecturers feeling like I knew the content well. His style of drawing things out when they're complicated and showing examples in that manner gave some depth to his teaching that I really appreciated, especially in the finite automata units. Though I sometimes felt like the content was a bit dry, I found him to be a more than good professor. The exams and quizzes being online were also very nice.",4
"not super organized, TAs grade suppppeerrr randomly, but cliff is rlly considerate online/take home exams were nice, all you need are justin's notes and you'll get an A in this class.",3
"CMSC250 with Cliff started off very well, but it ended with some noticeable flaws. This may be due to lack of teaching experience, miscommunication with the TAs, or some TAs slacking on their share of grading work. But PLEASE NOTE, I'm not considering class management in this review. Homework grading took a considerable amount of time, and there were often incorrect problems/solutions in exam practice problems. Whether this was Cliff's fault or the TA's, this was a major issue that stressed out many students and must be taken care of for future classes. 

Considering lectures, I thought Cliff was a solid instructor. Sure, some content could have been explained better, but Cliff made an effort and answered every question during or after lecture. I think the best way to prepare is to read Justin's 250 notes alongside regularly attending lecture. Other than doing the homework (yourself!), you should understand the general content. To me, lectures felt well paced and taught. Some content was boring, but well, it's 250. Just attend lectures and take notes and do your share of studying and you'll be fine.

Exams were fair. Quizzes were fair. Got extra credit opportunities sometimes.

Like others have said, Cliff is one of the most understanding instructors. If you approach him and explain your situation, he will accommodate. Super nice and chill guy.

I genuinely think that in a few years Cliff will be a top-tier instructor. Hopefully 250 will not have these issues with grading/TAs moving forward. 

Side note: Cliff might keep exams/quizzes online moving forward. Don't cheat with others. Not worth the risk and 250 content is important in later courses. You'll get imposter syndrome if you do.",4
"Immaculate hair, but his TAs are quite disorganized and grade inconsistently from each other.
His handwriting Isnt stellar so you have to pay extra attention to what he is saying and his lecturea overall arent too good for note taking since its almost all just examples, each being implement in a different manner. Regrades take ages and the autograder has had mistakes in almost every homework, 8/11 if im counting correctly.",2
"Solid guy, seems pretty chill. However, his teaching and course organization abilities are frankly dismal. Most assignments have errors in them, adding to that there would be grading mistakes for almost everything. Lectures are boring and hard to follow. The pacing of the material is extremely poor, with some lectures covering seemingly nothing important and others leaving many students confused. The worst part of the class, however, are the TAs. It is obvious that the TAs don't care about the class whatsoever, the discussions are poorly led and the TAs often give contradictory information. To do well in the class, students are forced to constantly haggle for points on blatantly ignorant grading. The material should be easy to understand but being in Cliff's section made this class far more stressful and difficult than it had any right to be. The silver lining is that Cliff is a new teacher and should learn from his mistakes as he gets more experienced, oh, and he has cool hair... I guess.",0
"I took Cliff in the Spring of 2022, and I probably have a totally different experience than everyone else. Cliff was a super flexible guy who cared a lot about his students, and he did try to set us up for success. I believe the downfall of the course was the disorganization and laziness of most TAs throughout the semester as the grading had a lot of errors for people with it being inconsistent as well (since everything was online). There were a lot of errors on assignments as well, which I hope Cliff is more cautious of next semester. However, i never really got affected by any of this and I really did enjoy and felt like I learned a lot in this class. Cliff offered tons of OH, and I know some cannot make it to OH, but i found it to be super helpful I could come anytime to OH whenever I had a question, and I would say all the in person TAs were super helpful this semester over the ones online. I will stand by my 5 star rating because I thoroughly enjoyed the class, I never had anything wrong happen for me, and Cliff (and all In person TAs) were super helpful to me this semester to learn discrete math. If you are willing to just get out of your bubble and try to use the resources Cliff gives you to the best of your ability, the class isnt too bad. Some materials that really helped me in the class was: The lecture slides, IN PERSON OH, Justins Notes, the recommended textbook, discussion slides and recordings from some TAs, and answer keys for every single assignment despite the errors.

I think Cliff will do a better job next semester and will eventually shape how he wants to structure his class in an organized manner soon.",4
"Pros: The class was entirely online and open note this semester so was not particularly difficult (stress load/work wise). His exams are more or less fair although a bit of a time crunch.

Cons: This man is a genius in everything EXCEPT teaching. His lectures are straight from Justin’s Notes (which carried me through the course), but the way he explains everything so disinterestedly makes them so hard to watch. Plus, the examples he provides in lecture are not well explained and incomplete. Honestly I ended up just using Justin’s notes for most of the class and the only reason I watched his lectures were to make sure I was using the style he wanted for proofs. However, there was no point as he is EXTREMELY inconsistent in grading. I don’t know if it’s him or his TAs. He goes back in what he says about style numerous times and the only reason I’m even finishing with a B is the amount of regrade requests I submitted. 

Overall, the only positive about taking Cliff this semester compared to the other professor is that his class was online. I feel bad for whoever has him in coming semesters in person. I honestly don’t know how I would pass the class with his terrible teaching and inconsistent grading . ",1
"Cliff is a great person and a decent teacher. He is definitely understanding of students' concerns and I feel that he teaches the material in the course properly (wish Cliff was more engaging though and enthusiastic). However, I think his management of the class was rather poor. Assignments were never graded correctly and very few TAs seemed to care about teaching the course material properly. There would be several times when a student had the correct answer and approach to solving a problem but would get graded incorrectly.  
I think that through better management and more enthusiasm for the content, Cliff could easily become a great professor. He is young and has a lot of time to improve. Hopefully, the class will go much better next sem.",2
"I think some of the bad reviews that he is getting on here are a bit unfair (especially the comment about his speech impediment) considering how accommodating he was to students this semester. He made all quizzes and exams online, moved multiple quizzes because of upcoming exams in other courses, and was generous in providing make-ups. Also after students complained about it taking too much time to take the first exam, he made the second exam and final shorter and easier. Grade averages this semester were pretty high for this semester, so not much of a curve will be needed.

For the most part his lectures went at a decent, if not a tad slow, pace. However, there were certainly some issues in the structure of this course. Grades took a very long time to come out for many assignments, and many times the TA's made mistakes in grading. But they were all rectified with regrade requests. Overall, I do think that taking this course with Cliff is a good experience, and I thought that all-around he was a very solid professor. There is no doubt that he truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed in his class. His luscious locks make attending lecture worth your while.",3
"People are correct about his disorganized class, but I think he still is a great prof to take. All exams and quizzes were online which was nice, and the overall was just a great and accommodating person. His lectures were tough to understand at times as his handwriting is pretty horrible. If he continues to keep the content online take him, if not then run. ",2
"I stopped going to his lectures and went to DVH's instead. In hindsight it was the right move as I went from having a 100% success rate of falling asleep in class to actually paying attention. I will say Cliff seems like a really chill guy and is approachable, however, I felt like he wasn't that interested with the content of 330, hence really dry lectures. Most of the material can be found on the slides or recordings so there's no need to show up. Exams were very fair. Projects weren't terrible(don't go to office hours last second). Quizzes were tough in terms of limited time, but doable. ",1
"Just gonna say, this class was so rigged and I'm so glad I'm out of the woods. Most people cheat and screw others over by making the exams have an unusually high average. Cliff is nice but also delusional when it comes to this issue. It was survival of the fittest/""get a high grade by any means possible"" all semester long.

The exam reviews were not that helpful and were recycled from last semester. Additionally, we were given wrong answers for them. I felt like two of the TA's at office hours took more of the role of professor than Cliff did in lecture. Can't even read his hand writing because he uses a super  pixelated drawing program. 

He also took out learning about logic circuits from the class which really sucks considering this is a computer science course it'd be nice to know about those.

Just be prepped to be at office hours regularly and maybe you'll do okay. ",1
really bad organization of the class,0
"Very nice guy, I think that's evident based on all the reviews, and if you take any course he teaches you will feel the same.

I feel like the reviews given for him for CMSC250 don't represent him as well. I had him last semester and got an A-, but he was pretty amazing for me. He did speak in a monotone manner though, which can be easily to cause you to daze a bit. People were saying he only has good reviews because he was co-teaching with Justin, but Cliff made his own slides for CMSC250 last semester and taught his own way, so I do feel he's being slandered a bit. Maybe it was because he was the main one to manage CMSC250 and Justin was the main one to manage it last semester, and if that's what people meant, then I suppose so. I felt he did great overall, but maybe this semester is different. I can't speak on that because I didn't take CMSC250 with him this semester, so my opinion may not be as valid as the others, although I feel the other reviews may be a bit over-exaggerated. 

In terms of CMSC330 though, he was pretty solid too. Not as much as 250 for me last semester, but he was still pretty good. He's very understanding as well. He doesn't question anything, as once I showed him what a TA said on a regrade request on my exam and fixed it on the spot, and he has a lot of sympathy for students. Sometimes he does get thrown off on a slide and gets confused or something, and sometimes he does blatantly read off the slides so going to lecture may not be optimal (he had lecture quizzes online so some people didn't really go to lecture, including me to be honest). The slides posted online helped me navigate through CMSC330 and helped build an understanding for each unit/topic we covered, along with understanding the whole purpose of the course. Sure, it may not be hard to post slides or he might have recycled them, but at the end of the day all the professor has to do is deliver information and make sure you understand it, and I felt like he accomplished that. The exams, quizzes, lecture quizzes, and projects of course were all online and open-note/internet as well, making it less stressful for students too.

Overall, it was hard for me to pay attention in lecture at times, but that's just me. I sometimes even daze off even in Justin's lecture. Sometimes Cliff's lectures felt like ""I can just look at the slides when he posts them"", but then that turns into ""I have to look at 15 slides the day before an exam"" which i found myself doing a decent bit lol. I didn't give him a 5 star because his lectures are somewhat dull because he's monotone, and that makes it harder to pay attention, especially when you're already lost on some topic. He's very sympathetic, and has great potential to be a great professor though. Currently, I'd give him 4 stars, and for the future when he adjusts to lecturing, managing and leading courses, and overall improve over time, I'd say he's easily at-least a 4.5 star. ",3
"The class pacing was fast but at the same time, I didn't want to learn the content because it was so uninteresting. In class, I did barely anything and I just looked at the slides during the lecture quizzes to learn the material for the day. He just seemed so tired after teaching CMSC250 that he didn't feel like teaching 330 at all. Seems like people were not fans of cmsc250 either. My TA was great though.",2
"Class lectures were a bit dry, though I would also blame the extremely dense powerpoints given for 330. While Cliff did at times do a good job explaining concepts to students and making sure to answer any questions, I ended up learning more by going to outside sources, and by doing the lecture quizzes and projects required for the course. Cliff definitely does care about his students though, and I don't think you'd do poorly if you had him as a professor.",3
"To do well in this course, study Justin's notes. For quizzes and exams, showing how you got the answer is important and you will lose points. However, Cliff doesn't teach how to do it, he just scribbles all over the board leaving the class confused. His class is manageable, but I would rather take it with someone who grades harder and teaches better.",1
"Chill guy, nothing wrong with his teaching per say. He mainly seemed uninterested in teaching, and had zero enthusiasm when lecturing. Didn't really go into a lot of detail when doing example problems in lecture, and I had a hard time not falling asleep. Exams and projects were manageable. For projects just start early and got to OH asap if you are stuck.",1
"I understand this is an accelerated summer class, that said some of the expectations made in this course were simply unacceptable.

I found it quite obnoxious when Cliff would say we have 10 days for a project then proceed to wait a week before teaching us all the content needed for said project.
The projects were honestly a pain. Some of the requirements felt more like tick questions designed to frustrate us rather than to actually display what we learned. 

That said lectures don’t get uploaded during the weekend; perhaps Cliff also needs a break over the weekend; however it would be nice to have something to reference when we have projects to work on over the weekends. 

In any case, Cliffs lecturer's examples were usually inadequate and not clear; they were not a good foundation for these projects. 

The difficulty between what we learn in class and the projects is too large of a jump, perhaps it’s not that surprising considering they are just reused projects from other professors, who gave weeks to work on the same projects we are given 6 days for.

The lecture quizzes were quite a headache. The slides don’t get uploaded the same day and so we are basically expected to just retain everything we had learned that day.

The exams weren’t great and averages weren’t very good. We were provided older exams to reference; however working on projects consumed way too much time away from studying. A Lot of us had to make a choice between getting the project done or studying. Even now at this moment we have a 4 part project due Friday the same day as our final worth 27% of our grade. I must seriously question if anyone would find this reasonable.

The class honesty left me feeling helpless at times, there needs to be more reasonable standards for projects and adequate time allocated on par with what we learn. I believe Cliff does care about these students but he needs to sort of look at things on our level and set reasonable expectations.

"Just took CMSC330 with Cliff over the summer.
The main issue with Cliff has been with his structure and administration of the course. Unclear deadlines and typos in assignments, quizzes, and slides were extremely commonplace when taking this course. Even what material we were going to cover over the condensed course was questioned a lot by the instructors and TAs. At one point, they even outright lied (probably not intentionally) about what was going to be covered/not covered on the final exam. All of this had a direct impact on the class, and this run of CMSC330 had some of the lowest exam averages on record (the class was curved substantially to make up for this). Apparently, this was due to Cliff somehow not being told that the course was going to only be 6 weeks long instead of 12 weeks long, but I digress.

As a lecturer, Cliff was not the worst. He typed things out in Vim to demonstrate concepts, but he went fast and it was largely hit or miss if this approach beat out just sticking to dense slides. For instance, typing out code in Vim made sense, but once we got to NFAs/DFAs and grammars... Why not use whiteboarding software instead? One plus is that he'd post ""Lecture Recap"" videos for each lecture for those who couldn't make it to class. Although, these videos would often be posted 3-5 days after the lecture they covered, so relying on them to keep up is ill advised.

While I didn't personally go to in person office hours (both in person and online OH were offered), those who did described the TAs as ""rude"" and ""bothered by questions."" This doesn't affect my evaluation of Cliff himself, but I felt that it was worth mentioning and pointing out that this is unacceptable behavior for TAs.

Overall, I would still recommend taking courses with Cliff over many alternatives simply due to his approachable nature as well as his modern online approach to teaching. He is still young and can only improve with experience and I believe Cliff has the potential to be a good professor. He cares and is accommodating to students, but as of now, he still has a way to go (and needs new TAs) before being truly exceptional.
Oh, and his hair was stunning.",2
"Cliff is an alright choice for 250. He's not amazing at explaining new concepts but not terrible either. Tests were pretty easy, though, especially when compared to the homeworks. Not a bad choice by any means.",2
"I would stay away if possible. His class management is very poor and his teaching is horrible. He over complicates everything and makes stuff harder to understand than it needs to be. However, his exams are very fair.",1
"Cliff is better professor for 330 than 250 IMO. He was definitely more interested in the material. Can be monotone at times, but covers the material well and gives a ton of practice resources for quizzes and exams.",3
"Pros:
- Slides are very detailed and easy to read
- Goes through many examples when explaining concepts
- Exams reflect content covered in lectures
- Offers extra credit

Cons:
- Doesn't post lecture recordings",4
Decent choice overall. Lectures can be a bit dry but the TA's are very helpful. Exams were pretty easy and fair,3
"jose and cliff cotaught this semester and i had jose, but this class was run more like a cliff class (everything on gradescope, quizzes, an online exam1, etc.) so it seemed like cliff was in charge of (and i'll blame him more for) course administration. in other words, this review is solely for course organization and not for his actual teaching. 

- lecture quizzes did not match what i learned in lecture. just cause i don't have cliff doesn't mean my section matters any less, and it's up to the instructors to make sure they material and the quizzes sync up between them. 
- the 5 large quizzes were all 20 minutes each, when they needed more time. i don't know why 250 got 2-hour quizzes but 330 20-minute ones. 
- office hours were a crapshoot; half the tas couldn't do project 4. obviously this isn't directly reflective of the instructor but he should at least put some effort into making sure all his tas are at least capable of the basic things students are expected to do. 
- exam 1 was poorly organized. the exam was way too long, and it seemed like although the tas each submitted a question they thought was ok, the fact that almost no one managed to finish that exam in time showed that no one testsolved it and that the tas' questions weren't organized and selected well. 

again, my review is only relevant to courses he administrates, not his lecturing style or competency. so, if you actually have him for a class, ymmv.",1
"I reviewed Cliff for 250 during Fall 2021 but I feel compelled to submit another review as I strongly disagree with his current rating and my opinion only strengthened when I took him for 330 during Spring 2022. He was an effective professor - sure he sometimes speaks monotonically, but he teaches the concepts very well. The pacing of his classes were perfect, and the projects and exams were extremely fair. He's also just a straight up nice guy; he's been through the UMD CS program himself and he knows how it is to be a student going through the very classes he's teaching. I strongly recommend Cliff, really can't go wrong by picking him.",4
"His TAs are inconsistent with grading. There have been multiple instances where my answer is basically the same as my friends but I get less points. I emailed Cliff for a regrade because it was impossible to get one done over gradescope (the TA wasn't taking my argument) and he never got back to me. The only reason I might get an A is because you get 10 extra points for using Latex on your homeworks, and two of them get dropped. I like his late tokens policy, even though I've never used them. I know it would have been nice to have that for some of my other classes.
Cliff sometimes gets confused during his lectures, but it's understandable since he's not as experienced as other lecturers. Other than that, he did a pretty decent job of explaining the concepts. His TA took over one of his lectures, though, and I think she was a lot better.",3
"Great professor who understands what the students are dealing with and changes/adapts to accordingly. 
This is only this second year teaching so there are a few rough edges but if you get in touch with him, he is more than happy to help. 
His slides could use a little more work especially towards the later chapters but at the same time, TAs release detailed notes on the topics discussed. There is also Justins Notes and the entire Fall 2020 250 class webpage to consult.",4
"I was really disappointed by Cliff's teaching. He seems like a really chill guy and was very helpful during office hours. However, his teaching was pretty uneventful. To begin, his slides were impossible to use. He decided to use reveal.js which, while being very sleek and clean, forced you to look through a 2D maze to try and find what you were looking for. Add to that transitions which prevented all necessary info from showing on the overview made it a mission to try and find a formula or method to do a problem. His lecturing wasn't fantastic either. He would mumble through his slides and not do a lot of in-class practice problems. A more class-wide issue was style. Having a style guide was very helpful in showing what would be accepted as homework/test answers. However, it would be more helpful to designate a specific way of doing a problem/signs to use to prevent confusion when one professor uses one symbol/method, the other uses different ones, and the TAs use whichever their profs used when they took the class. Although the previous gripes made the class frustrating, Cliff was very fair about how he ran the class. Each homework could get a 10% boost if you used Latex (which is not hard to learn/use) and almost every test/quiz had an extra credit question that was very possible to get right. He gave opportunities to submit homework late for full credit and even gave a supplement to a question on the first midterm that did not go well initially to boost test grades. He also gave a survey to gauge class satisfaction after the first midterm. All in all, a fair class but with sub-par teaching. 10/10 hair and fit though (worth an extra star).",2
"I wanted to like Cliff, I really did. He was a bad lecturer. He often got confused during lecture and his style was extremely different from what we were expected to replicate, making it impossible to do well in the class without studying the style guide. I stopped going to his lectures completely and instead watched Paul Kline's recorded lectures that we had access to while they co-taught. When I talked to him in person about issues with his TAs and their grading though, he was very understanding and willing to help with regrade requests.",2
"Decent instructor, but lectures can sometimes be boring. Exams (in-person) and quizzes (online) are fair but require studying. Weekly-ish homeworks were tricky at times but a few got dropped. Some TAs were very helpful and took time outside of discussion (which doesn't consist of graded assignments) for exam review sessions. The content itself isn't too difficult but can require some practice to understand. Would recommend taking it with him.",3
"Pros:
- lots of good TAs
- nice guy that will try to answer your questions

Cons:
- difficult to contact
- provided lecture notes are horrible
- often in lecture he gets lost and doesn't know what hes talking about which is kinda annoying
- overall just felt like he didn't know the content very well and wasn't great at teaching it either. It was his first time teaching the course though so ill give him the benefit of the doubt.",1
Really nice instructor. He's quite approachable during his office hours and answers questions or explains concepts really well. He has started from the basics many times even though it's repetitive/obvious. His lectures were quite good and I enjoyed his classes.,4
"Cliff was super nice and chill. I honestly didn't learn a whole lot but I think that may be the way Discrete Structures is as a class. His hair is mad luscious too. The exams were online when I took it in spring 2022, and they were very fair. His class did kinda reward cheating behavior, but I didn't mind it personally.",3
CMSC330 is a tough class. Go to office hours and start the projects early. Set aside a lot of time to prepare for the exams/quizzes/bi-weekly lecture quizzes.,2
"Overcomplicates lectures. Easy topics are discussed in such convoluted ways. Throws out terms and uses then without properly defining them. Dry lectures, doesn't record. lecture slides are subpar, however he does give decent notes that accompany the slides. Some trivial exam questions. However Exam 1 for this year was terrible, he expected us to remember how we implemented projects from a month or two ago. The data structure was super complex and he just expected us to remember how we did it.",1
"HIs lectures are boring and he puts a lot of time into explaining irrelevant things rather than the main points. The projects are pretty well written though, they have steps/helper functions that you put together to make the final thing",1
Cliff is a really cool guy; I found his lecture’s interesting and he explains the concepts really well. The projects are fun and he always went over helpful examples in class to help us get started. He is very detail oriented and explains thoroughly which I appreciated. I think he made this class very enjoyable!,4
"Taking 330 with Cliff is the right choice. Projects are challenging but not overly so, and his lectures are good, albeit a bit boring. But, he is funny and accessible and gets a lot of points for that.",3
"I like Cliff.  He's a pretty chill dude and has blimps of humor here and there.  I would heavily recommend going to lecture even if he has online slides because he covers material that may be difficult to understand strictly from reading.  The projects are hard but reasonable if you stay on track and don't procrastinate.  Expect to spend a decent amount of time on them, but once you complete them, you'll feel like a god.",4
"Cliff managed to take an incredibly well-designed course put together by professors like Jose and David Van Horn and turn it into a disorganized mess. It seemed like he almost never actually prepared for lecture or planned content out ahead of time. Rather than providing slides, Cliff would often just whip out a sheet of paper and decide what we would cover that day on a whim. I felt like he did a disservice to the content of this course and am disappointed that he will be the only instructor for it again next semester.

The only reason I am not giving him one star is that he is very understanding of students' concerns. However, it seemed to me throughout the semester that Cliff was more interested in playing the part of a ""cool professor"" than competently doing his job as a lecturer. He has a lot of room to improve.",1
"Cliff is a great professor for this class. He is always well prepared for lectures, he has a dry humor that is engaging and he explains concepts clearly with good examples. The projects are challenging but we are given plenty of time and they are really interesting. He is understanding and gives discussion notes on the class github that are great for helping us with where to start on projects. I had a lot of fun in this class. He slays.",4
"Cliff is a good professor. His lectures may seem monotonous but if your listen and take notes you will understand the topic. Projects are perfect, not too easy neither too hard. The Worst part is Slides. OMG Cliff has a map like slides which are so vague and annoying. This was so difficult cuz even if you listen in lecture towards the end of the semester you might need review concepts and his slides are just a big disappointment.",1
"the structuring of this class was actually perfect. only issue was that he was very mistake prone and he didn't record lectures while kline did, which lowkey saved everyone",3
"Cliff's overall a great professor and class is not too hard. My grade likely doesn't reflect that statement, but that's entirely my fault.",4
"Kind of nerdy, cool guy. Decent lecturer, but he doesn't record. Just show up and that doesn't matter. Rough but doable projects, one in particular was extremely difficult but as usual, start early and you'll be fine. Pretty reasonable exams and quizzes. Just show up to class, pay attention and take good notes, and you'll do well.",3
"You're in good hands. Good lecturer, very helpful on piazza. Absolute memelord as well and has lego kits on display in his office. About the review that complained about Exam 1, all you had to do was explain what you roughly did. You could even bullshit and come up with a solution on the spot as long as you knew what the project was (you should). The other part of that question was literally just a critical thinking exercise (as long as you did the project). Also, if a project is due before the exam, it's fair game and you know that.",3
"Cliff for 330 is by far the best choice. Some words of advice would be to start the projects early as the majority of them will be difficult and time consuming, but they are all doable. He give a lot of great resources and his TAs are all really good and knowledgeable, plus he has a lot of them, more than I've seen in any other class I've taken.",4
He has good notes on the topics and gives a lot of practice exams to use for studying,4
"Pretty good teacher. Actually cares about how the students are doing and has extended deadlines for projects when everyone was struggling. Only things that were annoying were there always being several errors on the exams that are found while we are taking the exam. Also he didn't lectures for some reason. In substitute for not recording the lectures, he would put out his own notes that he produced. These notes were usually pretty good imo but he just stopped making them towards the last month. For the Rust and garbage collection, he just linked us to previous year's slides which annoyed me.",3
"Probably my favorite CS class I've taken. Cliff's lectures are good if you can stay awake (I usually did not). Exams are straightforward and fair. Project were reasonable difficulty and really helped reinforce concepts learned in class. He does not record his lectures, but do have pretty good lecture notes, some topics do not have notes but I had no problem using online resources to get through. There was a slight curve at the end for my semester. Overall, a solid professor.",3
"Cliff is nice and his exams are fair. He has a lot of great TA's and the projects are also not bad at all. The only con I'd say is that Cliff's lecture style is a bit dull and boring to endure for 75 minutes, which I think could be fixed by recording his lectures, but Cliff does not seem to be interested in recording his lectures. But other than that, he's great!",3
"Amazing professor. Helpful TAs. Definitely recommend him.

Pros:
- Resources: you have all you need to review for quizzes and exams. Go to the class website and practice!
- Office hours: a lot of smart TAs are there to help.
Cons:
- Quizzes/Exams: I don't think I'm great at functional programming because I usually struggle with the topics. Even when I understand the contents, I make lots of dumb mistakes and I lose a lot of points on exams. But if you thrive, then congrats!
- Lectures: sometimes boring and dry, but you have the notes and TAs.

A few words of advice: start the projects early! Don't procrastinate. Have a good time management because you definitely will need it while doing the project and reviewing for the quiz or exam. Have a study group, too!",4
"- Good professor who is engaging and is very communicative with his students
- Very easy to email or to reach out to
- exam accurately reflects content in the course
- Large amount of TA’s in Office Hours (sometimes takes a while to get help if u go at a bad time, but overall good amount of TA’s)",4
"330 with Cliff was a solid choice.

330 as a class: this class was run much better than 216, so that was a breath of fresh air. There were a lot of TAs to handle OH, and the TAs I got help from knew what they were doing. There was a lot of practice material online from previous semesters, but I feel like the style of questions changed this spring 2023 semester because assessments were all in-person instead of online. However, I will say the exams and quizzes were fair game (if you really understand the material, I think it’s possible to do well, though I flopped them myself Projects were within reason if you vaguely understand the topics, start early, visit OH, and get the help that you need. 

Cliff as a lecturer: he got the job done (I mean he really is the only option so you can’t escape unless you drop out…?). He covered everything that was tested on (whether it be verbally or through writing), though I will say there were a few times I probably fell asleep in that lecture hall. Going to discussion to learn how to do NFA to DFA and OpSem were helpful.

Overall, I wouldn’t be too worried about this class with Cliff. I felt much less stressed in 330 with Cliff compared to 216.",4
"Lectures are very dull and monotone. But as long as you start on the projects they seemed alright (this class is horrible for procrastinators). I would recommend using class slides from other classes as well because Cliff's slides are really hard to navigate. Overall, decent class and he is understanding but doesn't really check his emails.",2
"Nice guy. Had him for 330 after 250 in the fall of 2022 and he taught the class pretty well. Quizzes and exams were pretty fair game and you'll be fine if you practice his old papers and go to office hours for help. Cliff is approachable in his office hours and explains stuff pretty well. Will miss him. 
Cliff, if you see this, thanks for being a good prof for a year. Have a good rest of your life",4
Boring lecturer but cannot write a coherent project description to save his life. Cliff needs to take ENGL393 or something before attempting to write a project.,0
"Terrible assignment descriptions, unfair quizzes, unhelpful explanations.",0
kid thinks hes philosophical with it but hes just booooooooooring and the projects are dog water,0
Horrible project descriptions making your life hell,0
"Just countering the most recent 2 ratings after this (as a different/current) student

There was a recent project that was convoluted and made by some TA(s). There were a lot of typos and it was confusing and vague. Cliff tried his best being super responsive on Piazza and clearing up any questions so I really wouldn't blame him. It was just not a good time overall for students and I understand ppl are stressed hence the bad reviews below. But overall Cliff so far has been really great",4
"The two reviews below were unnecessarily mean and did not explain in enough detail.

Look, Cliff's a good guy. And he's smart. But there have already been so many unclear things this semester, leaving a lot of the class frustrated.

The first quiz was rough. The median score was 11.5/20. The reason for this is largely the fact that we had only 20 minutes for two write-in coding portions, plus other fill-in-the-bubble questions, a few of which were annoying trick questions.

Project 2 was worse. The description was imprecise, and I had to turn to Piazza to understand what exactly he wanted, which nobody should have to do. Not to mention the fact that it was far too difficult for a project that was primarily intended to test your knowledge of regular expressions. I had to give up after spending my entire Friday night & whole day Saturday on it, while still failing two semi-publics. I've never had to do that in the past (granted, I had Larry Herman for my past two project based classes, who is probably way TOO descriptive). The most difficult part of the project also had nothing to do with any new content, and everything to do with (a) understanding what the heck we're even supposed to be writing, and (b) basically recursion stuff, which we all know how to do, but which was further complicated by various things Cliff had done to intentionally make the project more difficult.

There have been several other things. One is that, up until maybe the day before the first quiz, the syllabus had said that quizzes were open-note. And they weren't. Next, navigating his slides are like navigating fields of landmines. The slides have like three layers to them, and you can go up, down, left, or right. Which is further complicated by the fact that the slides appear to have a mind of their own, and they'll shift to random places when hitting the left or right arrows, when all you want to do is go back or forward one slide.

Perhaps Cliff's saving grace is the fact that he, and his large army of TAs, respond fairly quickly to Piazza posts. And he has notes online that have basically all the content, which is a plus. He is not a terrible lecturer at all, and he knows his stuff, which can't be said of everyone. And I genuinely feel bad that he's getting so much heat right now. But he does have some things to work on. I hope he realizes that, and the rest of the semester can be smoother.",2
Cliff needs to chill with these quizzes,2
Dont neglect this class,0
"Absolutely horrendous projects, they basically boil down to whether you can guess what he wants you to do.",0
"I think these reviews are generally too tough. The only thing holding my review back from 5 stars is the quizzes, which feel unnecessarily stressful, despite only being 2.5% of your grade each. Other than that, I think the class is taught well, and I really like Cliff's lecture notes, which cover basically everything that happens in lecture, and are very well-written. He also gives you access to previous exams and quizzes to study. The projects are probably more difficult then they should be, but if you start early you will be fine.",3
"Cliff is an incredibly boring lecturer but he provides you with every resource you need to succeed. Practice quizzes and exams are super helpful. This semester, one quiz and one project were extremely difficult but the difficulty has since gone down.",3
"Don't take this class lightly. I got an A+ in CMSC216, but it seems like every project in this class is worse than the next. Despite never procrastinating on them and starting the day they're assigned, sometimes it's just not feasible to finish the projects without spending over 20 hours on them. The project descriptions are vague, and whenever I went to office hours, the TA's agreed that compared to the semesters they took this course, the projects seemed more harsh and convoluted. 

I will say, Cliff is good at explaining the topics, the TA's are wonderful at explaining things and even if you're stuck with a crappy one for your discussion section, there's enough that if you go to office hours you WILL get any question you have about material answered. The material itself isn't overly challenging, and the tests are fair with a lot of practice material provided. But for a class so heavily dependent on the projects, I wish they'd put more thought into the workload they're assigning.",1
organized class and some extra credit(<2%). but the lectures arent the best. OH should help though,3
"This guy needs to chill. He has no teaching experience, is a mediocre programmer and his projects are outrageous (not only are the descriptions useless, but test cases are convoluted and meaningless). He is a terrible lecturer. Take Kauffman if you can.",0
"Nothing against Cliff but I am at a loss for words regarding the new projects introduced this semester (Project 2 and Project 6). If you can't provide a solid description for each project, how do you expect students to understand what they are being tested on for secret tests? it is a guessing game at this point and a good chunk of your grade is at stake.",0
"very chill and fun guy (nice hair), nice tas too
extremely helpful detailed note pages and fairly decent, understandable lectures
quiz 1 and project 2 were absurdly difficult but he seems receptive to feedback - gave extra late tokens after the horrors of project 2 and pretty much every project and quiz after has been easier and more reasonable
not a perfect class but it feels like he's down to earth and working to improve which is always good",3
"very mid ngl
-good notes
-horribly boring lectures
-some well-written projects
-some very disorganized projects
-exams are like practices
-quizzes are pretty chill other than the first one
-not insanely challenging exam wise
-projects are more tedious and leave more to interpretation
-tas are good, but they are always in the room and like never helping
-quick piazza posts
long story short, idt i learned shit, but this class isn't the worst",2
"Cliff is the definition of mid, the definition of a 3 star professor. Basically every aspect about his class structure and personality is mid. Not bad, not good.
- Lectures: Sometimes very informative, sometimes big wastes of time. Sometimes I'm engaged; most of the time I am not. The semester started with him using slides (which were really just visual aids for him and didn't serve as useful notes), but devolved into him just typing notes into Vim later into the semester as he talked. Lots of time wasted trying to spell correctly. Publishes decently useful notes.
- Exams: Two midterms. Usually pretty fair if not easy. Usually hits you with a couple really ambiguous multiple choice or true/false but he double majored in philosophy so he likes things abstract and theoretical. Cumulative final.
- Projects: Some were really, really hard. Others were fine. Lets you submit as many times as possible. No grading on style-- just tests, and usually these are all public or a mix of public and semipublic. Secret tests were on a couple projects but not most. As a result, they took a long time, but as long as you were able to get through it, they were easy guaranteed As. Project descriptions were kind of terse and didn't really describe what to do in edge cases, and I often had to rely on Piazza posts to get a full understanding of the project. But to be fair, going from Larry to Cliff was a big jump and usually he just doesn't test weird edge cases like Larry would. 
- Discussions: Completely optional unless there is a quiz. Dates for discussion quizzes given at the start of the semester. Quizzes are sometimes a time crunch. 4 quizzes throughout the semester.
- Reachability: I went to Cliff's office hours once and he was kind of standoffish. I've heard TAs are helpful and they are very responsive and helpful on Piazza. 
- Personality: I think Cliff is a chill guy but often times he just kind of came off as boring. He's weirdly interested in unconventional programming languages like Shakespeare and INTERCAL, but luckily this class's content allows him to talk about that a little and relate it to the lecture content and it was decently interesting. 

I'm basically entirely indifferent to Cliff. The class was fine. The semester was fine. I performed fine and am expecting an A. Wouldn't mind taking him again.",2
"Cliff is a good lecturer, I think most of these reviews are overly harsh. Cliff's lectures are boring, but he makes great lecture notes so going to class is practically optional. Exams are incredibly fair. My only complaint with Cliff is that some of the projects were too difficult and took too much time, and I wasn't a fan of having quizzes (only four though), but other than that he is a great lecturer.",3
"Cliff is really smart but his teaching style really did not work for me. 

He did a decent job of giving us the content, but does a bad job of explaining how the topics that we learn intertwine together, so it feels like we are learning random arbitrary topics for a while until the pieces finally go together in your own head.

The projects in this class were a mess. I believe a TA wrote project 2, and the description was really vague and no one really had any clue how to do it. Project 6 was also a really poorly written project – both needed added resources halfway through the project to help students understand what they had to do.",2
"Chill and class covers some interesting content. Some projects (especially project 2) were hard because of a lack of organization and foresight in project descriptions; if you had Larry and complained about his long project descriptions, these projects will make you appreciate them. Overall I think he was alright, I think a lot of salty people leave bad reviews because they are being confronted with the fact that a CS degree requires learning about how computers and programming actually works and not just making JS web-apps or something. So many people don't go to lecture but I highly recommend it, if you don't he has very good notes as supplement though.",3
"Very good choice for 330.
Pros:
- Has notes for each topic that gives more information than the lectures
- Office hours are very helpful (both Cliff's and the TA's)
- Lecture Quizzes that are easy and give a small grade boost
- Content on exam is spread out so there aren't too many points on one topic
- Also exams aren't hard
- Listens to feedback about class assignments

Cons:
- Projects can be hard at times 
- A few of the projects were also confusing but TA's were responsive on piazza
- Quizzes were hard (There are 4 in total each weighed 2.5%)

Overall:
If you start projects early (Basically the day they come out) and you use office hours, they're doable. Study for quizzes and exams. If you study throughout the semester, studying for exams won't be as bad. Also make sure you understand the topics well since you will (most likely) have a project on it.",4
"As a student, it feels to me that he designs the projects simply to trick students and not help them learn anything- showcases how smart he is!

Looking back, I don't really understand why he taught the way he did as I don't know what I learned. On the other hand, watching the other instructor's (Kauffman) lectures really helped me learn and also appreciate the course a lot more. Avoid Cliff as much as possible if you want to maximize a stress free schedule while also getting value out of the class instead.",0
"Overall, I thought Cliff was decent.

40% of your grade comes from projects. The only projects that were annoying were project 2 and project 6. Project 2 in my opinion was too much. Period. Project 6 was okay, but the evaluator part was somewhat annoying.

You have 2 mid terms both 12% and one final worth 22%. All exams are very fair, except the year I took it Kauffman and Cliff were coteaching. I think some exams were written by Kauffman.

Then you have quizzes and lecture quizzes. Lecture quizzes are fine and the quizzes are okay. When I took it, people performed poorly on quiz 1.

Cliff as a lecturer is okay. He definitely can get boring at times, but goes over all the content you need to know. He is also extremely helpful in OH.
 
The class also has a large amount of TA's. That's a plus as well.",2
"""AFAIK cliff is cringe. cliff, cringe jk idk is cringe"" - CMSC330 Final Summer 2023

Cliff is kind of a middle of the road professor at this time.

The biggest problems currently are the lack of good project documentation and poor administration.  With the project documentation, even outside of the dreaded project 2, the README's consistently left out important information which I needed to scrub through Piazza to get.  With administration, projects were pretty much developed on the spot as far as I'm aware, as the autograder was consistently released well after the project start date, and project 8 had a massive delay.  Both of these factors make projects much more of a pain than they need to be, as development problems are more often something poorly/not addressed in the README rather than programming logic errors, and ""semipublic"" testing is delayed until the autograder is up.  In addition, while ultimately minor, the lectures were honestly fairly boring and disorganized, as many of them are freeform coding/drawing sessions, but the coding particularly doesn't work because much of the time is spent on coding instead of getting across the main points.  Finally, 20 minutes for the quizzes just feels too short, and 25/30 minutes seems far more reasonable for the assessments they are.

For the good, besides the project 8 fiasco, the TAs, Cliff, and Kauffman were all fairly active in responding to Piazza inquiries.  Most of the projects themselves, except for the infamous project 2, have all boiled down to reasonable implementations.  The lecture quizzes were fairly useful, and the amount of forgiveness on them was really nice (I missed one by accident and still got full credit for lecture quizzes).  Exam weighting made exams not overly stressful, and the exams themselves were incredibly fair, which was nice after taking some past exams with fairly memorization-heavy questions (like coding an OCaml parser from memory).  Finally, Cliff and the TA's seem to know when things were screwed up, such as with quiz 1 and project 2, which is reassuring.

Overall, you will likely do well with Cliff.  Exam averages were around 85 across the board, and nothing seemed too unreasonable at the end of the day (well, almost).  I think he's middle of the road right now, but chances are with a bit of fine tuning, he'll turn out to be a great professor.  Hopefully things get sorted out, as I understand the course is going through some growing pains right now.  At the end of the day, I would still recommend Cliff.  That is, if you had the choice, as CS class registration is in a terrible place right now.

One more thing, I didn't really like Rust as the final language of 330.  It kind of just boiled down into a mess of language rules, and the rust projects were not as effective as the OCaml projects in getting us acquainted to the language imo.  The original plan was to tack on Racket, and honestly, I would have much rather had that instead of Rust, as I feel it ties into the themes of the course much better.  It also has the side effect (get it) of preparing us better for 430.",2
"Very nice guy. He has pretty decent notes on his website, and we also have a piazza which is fairly responsive. His lectures aren't the best (half the time he walks in with his xps and starts typing in vim), but they basically cover the same amount of stuff as his notes, which makes it tempting to skip class. The projects are mostly good, as well. Overall, not a bad professor. The course content carried hard, though, since I personally found it interesting and at times fun.",3
"Took CMSC330: Organization of Programming Languages with Cliff Bakalian in Fall 2023 (CS major requirement).

1.5 stars for this class, I reserve 1 star for Kruskal.

Felt like Cliff really did not care about the well-being and success of his students in their own terms, only did what he wanted.
e.g. he feels that uploading answers is beneficial so he will upload but he will not go out of his way on anything else.
Maybe he's not expected to, but it makes you miss a teacher for Nelson for example.

Everything is available on the class website, fortunately: https://bakalian.cs.umd.edu/330/resources

Cliff runs one of the better-administered courses, but he can still mess up: project is released really close to finals with no prior communication, exams taking forever to grade.

Entire class was so theoretical I am worried. It's the 300 levels; when do things begin to relate to the real world?
Probably not Cliff's fault, but I need to go out there and build things that people will pay me for, not just convert NFAs to DFAs and learn about lambda calculus theory.

Exams: I felt these were brutal.
Felt like no amount of preparation would prepare me for them.

Projects were also brutal, for the first time I found myself liberally using up late tokens.
Often unreasonably difficult and only achievable with a lot of stress, time, tears, and assistance.

Heavy workload.

Cliff has both positive and negative marking, so the grading is all over the place and you are hit with heavy penalties that will obliterate your score.
Another recent reviewer from my batch mentioned how the exams are easy but I found them very difficult, maybe it's just me.

Absolutely terrible lectures, Cliff is notorious for them. No idea what is going on. I only went for the participation points and to stay abreast somewhat of what was happening but basically you have to learn yourself.

Discussions are bad, but not the fault of the TA who was very nice (Amr Tairi).
But I felt that what we did discussion was not so helpful.

Don't even get me started on the office hours -- both the TA office hours and Cliff office hours.

Cliff will actually help you, the problem is that he is spending one hour with the person who came before you even though there is a queue of six people. 
I got fed up and went just once.

TA office hours were objectively THE WORST and a NIGHTMARE, and yes it is Cliff's fault because he is the boss of the TAs.
He let them walk all over him and do a bad job. 
Don't tell me it's not Cliff's fault; Cliff has created a culture. 
TAs are consistently excellent under Nelson because he actually cares about his students.

- Tiny, two desk open area swarming with people, filled with off-duty TAs who just use it as a place to hang out and have a good time amidst all the suffering.

- Takes HOURS to get a TA, during non-peak hours (e.g. day after the project is due) who: 
	- Looks down upon you like you are some kind of parasite wasting their time
	- Doesn't even try to understand what you are saying
	- Basically just says ""I cannot give you the answer"" when all you are asking for is some guidance 
	- Not only does not help, but gives you the WRONG answer 
	- Spends five minutes with you and leaves.

It was truly terrible.

Frankly I've heard Kauffman teaches well, but everything else he does the same with Cliff. So maybe just take Kauffman and benefit from Cliff resources? I don't know, check out his reviews.",1
"Cliff is an ard professor in my opinion. 

Pros:
good TAs
fair exams and quizzes(except quiz 1)
He tries his best to help the students
Bonus points for participation

Cons:
boring lecturer 
does not record 
Some Difficult projects(Every CS coding class is going to have difficult projects so it is what it is)

Overall this class was not that bad",3
"this class has a lot in terms of work but it’s not really too terrible in terms of difficulty. thought multiple times i was going to get like a 50 on a exam including the final but i was always surprised that i would score high 80s on them and it’s not cus im goated and all that it’s really just cus cliff is a decent teacher. Been a while since i saw B in a computer science class so yeah. Only few things sucked like quiz 1 and like 2 projects but it didn’t really affect me in the overall grand scheme of the class and my grade since if you get 50 percent on those things it was like only 7 percent gone. i imagine he’s going to learn from them as well to fix them and such. that being said, he could have small hiccups like those for future semesters and if youre a tryhard that might be an issue but cliff will sure try his best to accommodate to it if it happens. Overall i enjoyed having cliff as my teacher and i can definitely see him becoming a really good professor, dudes only like 25. his lectures were kind of boring tho but so is every professor i ever had except for justin",4
"He is a pretty decent lecturer and is pretty kind. However, the course is designed to be a lot of self-teaching. For example, we jump into projects with three different languages that we are unfamiliar with and are expected to teach ourselves the syntax and find different functions to use. The discussion sections are helpful, but the quizzes are hard and we are not given a lot of study material. The past exams and quizzes do not relate to how the class is structured now, so it is hard to prepare for them. They do curve most of the assignments, which is helpful if you bomb one or two assignments in each category.",3
"average lecturer. he's not bad by any means, but not the best either. since lectures are so long, it can get very boring to the point where you don't want to attend. his exams are of medium difficulty. some projects are not that bad, but a few of them are terrible, almost to the point where you cant even do it at all. quizzes are not that bad.",2
"exams werent bad at all, quizzes were hit or miss, but just make sure to manage your time with projects. cliff is a pretty decent lecturer as well. 

overall felt like a breath of fresh air compared to larry herman's 216-- no style points, mostly public/release tests, exams weighted a lot less than projects, extra credit if you participate, late tokens, etc. 330's also much more skill-based than rote memorization.

my one complaint was there was a project that was very poorly written in the beginning of the semester. it was a terrible time trying to figure out how to interpret it even with the extension. but, projects after that were much clearer.",4

#[derive(Debug)]

In all honesty, Cliff tries his best and cares about the academic success and wellbeing of his students. Thanks for a great somewhat chaotic semester!",4
"I LOVE THIS MAN. He started off the first lecture saying something like ""welcome to the best course in the cs department"" and ngl looking back, he was not lying. I consistently sat in the first two rows (as was advised by friends who took 330 w Cliff in past semesters) which helped tremendously. I really like the course material too. There was a lot of interesting content that I feel would always use in my cs endeavors going forward. Quizzes were difficult, I consistently got 10-15/20 until the last quiz; they were difficult because the formatting kinda threw me off. Also, I'm such a fan of Rust that I'm sad we didn't get to use it a lot in this class. Some problems are that there are some lack of materials sometimes because of how much the course curriculum changes on a semesterly basis, but Anwar came in clutch by giving us the format for like exam 3 (?). Cliff sometimes goes a bit fast during his lectures, but sit in the front rows FOR REAL and you'll be an OCaml master in no time. Watch his cool hair flips and laugh at his snarky jokes. Yeah he's my favorite professor thus far.",4
"interesting class. cliff is cool. lectures could be better, but overall I enjoyed it.",3
"It was a good class. It was well taught and organized, and his notes were very good if you missed something in the lecture.

The projects were all alright, although there is room for improvement with some (which will happen, as this was just after a major restructuring of the course). His Rust knowledge was a little spotty, though.",4
"Cliff runs the most organized class I’ve taken at UMD. Exams, projects, and quizzes were all fair, and I didn’t have any major complaints. His lectures are a bit boring, and his slides are practically useless, but his notes are really good. You should be aware that projects are modified/made from scratch during the semester, so some projects will have important clarifications after their release and the auto-grader is often released well after the project is. I’d definitely recommend taking him.",4
"Clippy? More like Cliffy.

Cliff is honestly a pretty great lecturer in my opinion, despite what I came in thinking. Although all of his lectures are mostly him typing in VIM, so it's pretty hard to take structured notes, I think he explains topics quite well, and his notes on the 330 website are pretty great and do much more than what's needed. Tests are really fair, though sometimes some questions are a bit tricky (nowhere near as bad as something like a Yoon question though lol). Quizzes are honestly kind of easy to mess up from my experience, but there's only 4 of them and they only make up 10% of the grade. 

I will say my main strike against this class is the fact that it's pretty disorganized at many points. This comes up in many ways, but just one of them is the fact that projects and their descriptions could be quite unclear.
I also wish Piazza was a tiny bit more responsive: sometimes there were questions we really wanted to have answered, but they were sorta delayed.

But really, I'll be honest, Cliff was honestly a pretty nice experience. Would give 4.5 stars if I could :)",3
"Loved the class, very little busy work, intentful projects, fair exams. There are once a week lecture quizzes where you can collaborate with people so it's not hard to get a good grade on those and they act as a little grade boost. He and anwar gave extra credit that was max 1% that came from discussion attendance/participation. I never went to discussion so I didn't really get those points but it's easy to get those. He also gave 1% if 90% of your section did the course evals at the end of the semester. The projects to take a while but I really liked them. Just make sure to start them early so you're not working for 12 hours straight for 3 days in a row like me.  The 4 quizzes throughout the semester were kinda hard but not too bad if you studied. The biggest complaint was about the final this semester. The general consensus was that it was really hard(I studied a while so I did alright) but the average was 68 and he did not curve it. One other issue was the handling of exam 1. I was in a section that had a fire alarm go off right before we took the exam so ours got postponed two days. This was fine but our lecture's exam average/median were about 10% under the other classes. But, at the end of the semester, I only got a 5% boost on that exam, so I think they either curved it on a bell curve or just didn't curve it as much as I think they should have. This probably won't happen again so thats not really an issue in the future but just something to note.",4
"CS 330, a hard class they say,
But I never did much work anyways
They groan and they sweat and sometimes they cry
But to that I say ""I didn't even have to try""

Speaking seriously, Cliff's 330 is a great class and not very difficult. You'll learn a lot from his projects. Take him!",4
"5 stars because even though lectures weren't really my style, they were informative and covered the material well, and anything else you need is in his posted notes. The main thing I disliked was his use of typing things into a REPL and explaining using that instead of pre-preparing notes and going over them with us - the same info was gotten, but it was much harder to take live notes effectively, and led to some errors in lecture. I went to his office hours once and he personally and patiently explained a concept to me until I understood, which was nice. He also co-teaches with the other prof each semester, so if you hate his teaching style you can just use the other prof's notes.

Exams and quizzes are odd for me to review. In my semester, I found them very easy. I checked out a friend's exam when she got it back and they look a bit harder now, though quizzes look the same. However, the profs generally share exams/quizzes so this isn't really a big thing to choose Cliff/not choose Cliff. I was in the class with the 11.5 average (/20) quiz1, and got almost full points - the main issue was that it focused a lot on a small concept (the one that he explained to me one-on-one, actually), so anyone who wasn't comfortable with that was a bit screwed. However, he gives full copies with answers for all past semester quizzes, so it was clear that this concept was important and you had material to study for it with.

The topics are very conceptual. I think this class is like an ""intro to compilers"" more than anything else. They introduce a lot of concepts that aren't super useful on their own but could turn out useful if you do research or language development, especially. There are also a few small things that are useful (intro to git, use of map/reduce(fold), PBT, regex) in general coding work as well. 

Overall okay class, enjoyed it with Cliff.",4
He's a great professor. He's really lenient with extensions which is something I myself have appreciated with; he is reasonable with course requirements. Definitely take.,4
"Pros:
- The lectures were informative, substantive with both slideshows and coding demoes. I thought discussions were a great way to practice the material. 
- The interactive exercises that TAs and the professors coded that were listed on the class website were great (e.g., lambda calculus, nfa to dfa). 
- The practice exams and quizzes were also very helpful.
- The lecture quizzes and discussion quizzes also made sure I was prepared.
- The projects also were generally very good, especially making me think with the secret tests
- TAs are very very helpful at helping me think about the problem and push me in the right direction without giving me the answer, and just explaining concepts in general. 
- Office hours are very efficient. He uses Quuly which is an app for managing office hours without needing a whiteboard or just trying to figure out who's a TA and who's a student. It tells you the expected wait time and options for both virtual and in-person office hours. I would highly recommend going to office hours on days other than the 2 days before the project, because then you'll get attention almost immediately. 

Basically the course is very well-structured, grading is very fair, content is very interesting and valuable, course load is very manageable for a hard-working student, and lectures are self-contained (meaning you don't really need to learn the content outside the class). You won't go wrong with Cliff, he's a great lecturer, runs a great class, and I would highly recommend.

That said, this was my hardest class of the semester and the most significant amount of time. But that's just me.

Cons:
- Personally, I thought Cliff's public speaking needs improvement. He paces and has lots of vocal fillers. Sometimes he talks in a tone that makes him sound bored or frustrated. But none of this actually matters.
- Sometimes he runs into errors during his coding demoes in lecture and wastes time debugging which he should have done before lecture. I think it's unprofessional
- Most of the time when I failed a test in a project it was because the project instructions didn't specify what I needed to do in that case, so I had to go to office hours to figure it out. But that didn't take much time.
- Too many times he finished lecture early. I think if I added all of that time together, we could have fit in at least 1 or 2 more lectures with more content. I am strongly opposed to classes ending earlier than the schedule.",4
"I'm not sure why Cliff has low-ish reviews. I guess that CS students love complaining that the professors whose lectures they don't attend are bad at teaching. I'll start with the bad, because honestly, there is not that much. Firstly, he doesn't post his notes on time. Most of the time, his notes are posted days after the lecture went over them, which can be quite annoying for those who like to review notes before or after lectures. Secondly, he's somewhat disorganized when teaching, and his in-class reviews and examples are all over the place. Other than that, he's an amazing professor. He has plenty of review material for both quizzes and exams, and has practice utilities. The exams and quizzes are also very fair. Some of the projects can be tedious, but he gives ample time for students to complete the projects, which are integrated very well into the material that is taught. Overall, a pretty good professor.",3
"First, the cons, which is mainly one thing:
- His lecturing style did NOT work for me. It's pretty disorganized, and though I pretty much stopped going to class altogether after about a month, I didn't often walk out of class with a good sense of what had just been taught. The lecture slides are kind of all over the place and skim the concepts very quickly, and the he just kind of freehands examples in VIM. You can tell during lecture that the class is pretty disengaged.
HOWEVER, there are a lot of things that I appreciated about Cliff's class! He was co-teaching with Anwar, and I heard similar complaints about his lectures from other people. To be honest, I ended up mainly just self-teaching, which I've never done before honestly, and reading Cliff's notes (which are great, READ THEM if you don't want to get tripped up on T/F questions) and Anwar's slides before quizzes/exams. It worked out okay for me, but I don't know if I'd be excited to do it again. The projects are pretty challenging and time consuming, but they leave you with a great understanding of the material. In addition to just studying before tests, I think that the projects did a lot of the teaching for me in this class. There are extensive review materials before the midterms and the midterms enjoyably employed an extremely similar structure to Spring 2024, so they were super doable. Quizzes were hit or miss but oh well.",3
"He's a cool professor.  Average at lecturing and boring at times but he'll crack jokes and answer student's questions very well.  The course content itself is boring.  Probably the most boring CS class I've taken (but not Cliff's fault lol).  Medium difficulty and easier than 216 IMO.  I'd recommend taking cliff and think his more recent reviews reflect him better than the old ones.  Seemed like he wasn't too good at lecturing as a fresh grad I guess, but he worked out the kinks from his previous course mishaps and lecturing style.  Also lectures are not recorded but his slides are detailed and he gives a ton of extra practice.  There's easy weekly lecture quizzes, and he posts all the previous semester's exams and quizzes so there's a TON of study material.",4
"This course was co-taught this semester with Anwar Mamat, but Cliff was okay as a teacher. 
His teaching didn't work for me, perhaps because he often doesn't explain how things connect too well or motivate the topics we're doing in class. Often, I'd feel more confused about a topic after hearing Cliff explain it in a lecture. Thus, after finding lectures futile, I just used the posted slides and notes, which proved to be more helpful. 
For logistics, he gives weekly take-home quizzes, which are meant to be collaborative—but they can basically just be seen as forced studying material, or like homework. Moreover, he gives four quizzes throughout the semester, which take place in discussion and are good for forcing us to study material, aside from exams. 
The exams were pretty fair, admittedly they were probably easier than they could've been (which I appreciate). The Final, however, I found pretty challenging overall. 
Ultimately, this class is quite confusing and Cliff didn't ever really help clear any ambiguity of this sort, but if you can learn the material through the slides or notes then it's rather easy from there.",2
"Lectures are terrible, but I highly recommend attending Anwar's lectures. The material covered in class is often straightforward, but  he tends to overcomplicate it and deliver ineffective lectures. When he taught a concept like ""NFA to DFA,"" I realized I wouldn’t be attending his lectures anymore.

The TAs, on the other hand, do a much better job explaining topics. They use a table-based approach for concepts like NFA to DFA, making it simple to understand. Unfortunately, Cliff skips such practical explanations and complicates the material unnecessarily. While it might seem easy to grasp once you already understand the topic, he doesn’t adequately cover the basics, which is crucial for students learning it for the first time.

The 330 projects were often quite challenging, but I understood their importance since it’s a project-based class, and I was okay with that. However, if you're trying to learn effectively, I strongly advise avoiding Cliff and opting for Anwar instead. They also offered a 2% grade boost if you completed the course evaluation and attended at least eight discussions, which was a nice.

Additionally, my discussion section leader was extremely helpful. They covered critical topics that were essential for quizzes and midterms, so I recommend attending those sessions. Some of the coding questions from previous finals were ridiculously difficult, almost as challenging as the projects. However, in Fall 2024, we got lucky, as the difficulty seemed more reasonable.",1
"DO NOT WORRY ABT THIS CLASS
Cliff is my goat. Yes, sometimes lectures can be a bit messy, but he's really good at explaining things one-on-one AND his notes are fantastic. If going to lecture isn't doing it for you, I suggest going through his notes instead. 

Projects are actually great, and complement/reinforce what was covered in lecture. Finally, he provides basically every quiz or exam for the class from the past 5 years, and assessments this semester were always similar to those in the past. So, grind those past quizzes and exams and you'll be chilling. 

And if that wasn't enough, he gave us 2% extra credit for basically free (filling out the course eval survey and attending discussion). The 75th percentile was a 95. That means more than 25% of people got an A. You do not have to worry about 330 if you're taking it with Cliff. Just sit back and enjoy learning without stressing about your grades!",4
"To sum things up concisely, the topics covered in this class aren't bad, but Cliff's lecturing style hurts overall engagement. I could not attend an entire lecture without sleeping or doing other work. Most of my productive learning came from reading Anwar's slides and Cliff's notes and starting the projects early. Exams, on the other hand, were pretty chill. They were very similar to past semester exams posted on the website. The quizzes were meh. As many others have mentioned, the first quiz is generally the worst. After we took the first quiz, my TA said, ""Congrats, guys. The first quiz historically has a D average."" Don't panic about the first one; the others are much better.

Overall, three stars for many opportunities to help your grade/do well. Minus two stars for Cliff's lecture engagement.",2
"im just gonna say that i don’t think that cliff is a bad professor in terms of exams and quizzes. everything was super fair and as long as you understood what was happening in class, you were fairly fine. that being said, i’m not sure if im fully convinced that he’s a good lecturer. i went to every lecture and tried to pay attention, but a lot of times it seemed like he was just talking to himself. i also didn’t really like the format of his slides since when i was going through them on my own time, if i hit the wrong key i’d end up like four slides ahead. i really liked his notes, though, and they really helped during projects (which are very cool btw!!). overall, i think you’re eventually going to have to end up self-studying most of the content (especially rust), but he’s not a bad professor to take.",3
"First, I'm just going to start by saying, for CMSC330, it really doesn't matter much who your professor is. The lecture quizzes, projects, discussion content, TAs, quizzes, and exam content are all exactly the same. The only difference between Cliff and Anwar's sections are which professor's lecture you can attend, but even then, you can just not go to lecture or go to the other professor's lecture (some people found that they didn't really like Cliff's lectures and attended Anwar's instead---the class is big enough that I don't think people would notice). Unlike CMSC351, the professor doesn't make that much of a difference for this class, so don't freak out too much. That being said, I do think Dr. Mamat has the better slides and also more experience in the field, so if you do have a choice, I would probably choose him.

Here are my comments on the course in general (this applies for both Dr. Mamat and Cliff's sections):
- All the class information is available here: https://bakalian.cs.umd.edu/330
- Literally 44% of your grade is free. Why do I say this? Projects make up 40% of your grade and you get around two weeks for each of them (give or take). You can ask questions, ask the TAs, look up documentation, submit as many times as you want, etc. within those two weeks. Each project took me between two and eight hours. There is literally no reason not to get 100% on every project as long as you don't procrastinate. The median on every project was between 97% to 100%. So again, there's literally no reason not to get 100% on every project, and they make up 40% of your grade.
- 4% of your grade is lecture quizzes, which are completely open internet. You can run the code on your own machine, and the lowest couple of lecture quizzes get dropped. So between the lecture quizzes and the projects, 44% of your grade should be completely free (as long as you don't procrastinate).
- The quiz medians were: Quiz 1: 14.5/20, Quiz 2: 15/20, Quiz 3: 17.25/20, Quiz 4: 16/20. You get access to all of the course's quizzes and solutions from previous semesters, which is helpful for studying. I honestly found the quizzes to be harder than the midterms. I will say, though, that I didn't do very well on the first two quizzes, but after that, I started buckling down and really studying and I got 100s on the last two quizzes. You'll be fine as long as you study and really understand the content.
- 46% of your grade is two midterms and the final. The medians were: Midterm 1: 83, Midterm 2: 87.5, Final (with extra credit): 89.48. Just like the quizzes, you get access to every previous midterm and their answer key, and around ~85% of the content on these exams is the same every semester. They do change things up a bit sometimes (like I think we did more garbage collection than they did in previous semesters), but most of the exams cover very similar content to previous semesters, so it's really helpful to take previous exams for practice. And yes, there's extra credit too.
- The discussions were fine. I didn't find them too helpful. There were good review questions, but they were all in a publicly-available GitHub repository that you could look at without going to discussion. Honestly, unless you're really confused about something, you can usually just look up your question online or on Piazza. There are a gazillion resources out there for Ocaml and Rust.

For Cliff in particular, I thought his lectures are okay. He goes at a very manageable pace; definitely not fast by any means. He can get pretty theoretical sometimes. He answers questions well.

TLDR; This is a fairly easy class as long as you don't procrastinate on your projects and do previous quizzes/exams as practice. I would recommend not starting the projects any later than the weekend before they're due. You could definitely knock them out over the weekend (if you don't mind working on the weekends). I thought the content was fairly interesting, although obviously that's extremely subjective and is up to how interested you are in this type of stuff. I would recommend taking Dr. Mamat but it really doesn't matter that much.",3
"cliff is honestly a pretty good lecturer, all things considered. his quizzes tend to be on the tougher side, but his exams are all very fair. his projects were confusing to start due to the instructions providing little guidance, but i enjoyed them since they related back to the content we were learning in class (and as a result, strengthened my understanding of the content in the class). imo, he's decent at explaining concepts, but his public speaking skills are a little weak and as such, he talks very monotonously and his lectures feel more like he's talking to himself than to the class. that being said, he's also very funny, but he delivers his jokes in the same monotonous tone as the rest of his lecture so unless you're paying attention, you won't notice them. my main two complaints regarding the class were (1) i felt as if rust was not taught well because he only went over the theory of what makes rust different from other programming languages and the two rust projects were honestly free-for-alls, and (2) because of the content of the class changing frequently, studying from previous exams can only help so much. all in all though, i definitely enjoyed cliff's class and i think he's a solid professor for 330, and would be willing to take a class with him again. that being said, i believe that anwar has similar reviews to cliff and since they co-teach, my advice for choosing between the two is to first pick whoever works better for your schedule, and if they both work well, then choose cliff",3
"Cliff is very hard to reach at times when you are trying to schedule office hours, barely interacts with the class during his lectures and worst of all he does not curve. If you take him, I recommend doing your best to get the percentage of the grade you want because he will not help you curve to the next letter grade. You're basically on your own. The quizzes were questionable in terms of difficulty, and his lectures barely covered them.",1
"TL;DR: Just take Cliff for 330

Pros:
- The exams and quizzes were very similar in nature to the practice exams and quizzes we were given, and there were a TON of resources to study with, so I never really felt unprepared going into an exam or quiz.
- We had a decent amount of time to complete projects, and there we were also given three 24 hour late tokens that we could use as extensions on the projects, so that was helpful.
- Cliff has incredibly thorough notes to help with learning stuff for the projects, quizzes and exams. 

Cons:
- Cliff's teaching style is not for most people. Lectures can feel disorganized and it's really easy to lose interest quickly. Most of my friends and I just learned the material by reading his and Anwar's notes, and doing the projects.",3
"sometimes i called him clifford baka
Pros:
Class overall is not as bad as the horror stories suggest
Projects were interesting
He's funny
Exams were fair

Cons:
It was kinda funny how no one paid attention in lecture, he's not terrible but he's very monotone and it does get hard to pay attention
Some of the projects were BRUTAL but looking back kinda straightforward, def go to office hours if you can snag a TA they are helpful

Overall, you'll be fine, go to office hours",2
"Was okay, just do the work and pay attention, midterms were somewhat similar and the concepts are taught to the same degree.",3
"Cliff's lectures were kind of pointless. Between his notes, the lecture quizzes/projects, the discussions (which also honestly weren't too helpful), and the online documentation for OCaml and Rust, I don't think Cliff's lectures really provided that much more value.

I think Cliff should strongly consider doing a flipped classroom. I think that would be a much better use of lecture time.",2
"🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐

Good at teaching compsci AND philosophy",4
"Cliffs lectures can be boring sometimes but overall, he's a good and fair professor. I would recommend anyone to take him. You will do well if you put in the effort. The first exam was wayyyyyy worse than the second. The projects weren't too bad. Secret tests were annoying for some of them but you can easily get A's on most of the projects.",3
"Pretty okay! Cliff and Anwar co-teach so you have both their lectures and their notes. Cliff's notes are really nice! But Anwar slides are goated. He has a slight accent but not really; you'll be fine.
- 2 midterms.
- 1 final.
- 7 projects (all weighted differently).
- 4 quizzes (during discussion).
- 11? 12? lecture quizzes (you do them at home, not during lecture). 

PLEASE START PROJECT 5 EARLY PLEASSSEEEEEEE E E EE",2
"He mad the class way too hard because previous semesters people were cheating a lot, the exams were really hard, projects were fair, but challenging.",1
"Class is not crazy hard, I just didn't invest as much time as needed. Cliff teaching style is very jumpy as he just codes and comes up with examples on the spot. The projects were detailed and made your work. Hardest ones in my opinion were 5,4, and 7 but others were fairly simple. Ample practice for quizzes and exams. Discussion practice was useful and I learned more there than in class.",1
"So you came here to decide whether you should take 330 with Cliff or Anwar. Well I'm here to tell you that you should just choose one that has a better schedule for you.

In terms of course structure, the projects are the most demanding part of this course. Especially project 5 (you'll see it when you get there). I know this is said in every CS course review ever, but I cannot emphasize this enough when I say that you should start these projects THE DAY they are assigned. Now I will say there were some people who would start the projects with 2-3 days before due date (most people have other overlapping courses like 351) so they can be a bit constrained for time, but still would get it done somehow. However, like I said, the projects are the most important source of learning in the course. Rushing to do them just to pass the test cases is very counterproductive. Use the projects to master the concepts you learn in class (I did NOT do this, hypocrite much??Shh keep reading) and you will see that the exams and quizzes are SO much easier. Any sort of ""coding"" question you get in a quiz or exam is some permutation of a function you implemented for a relevant project. So if you're not a GPT warrior and actually implemented the functions by understanding what its asking for, those questions should be a breeze. I'll be the one to say it...OCaml is really not that bad to understand (cry about it yall just work with any code that isn't written like a pseudocode). The syntax is really trivial to grasp especially if you have worked with ""let"" expressions in JS. HOWEVER, the functional programming aspect of it is where it gets tricky. But once you have enough practice with the first two projects (really only the first project because it is designed to teach you how functional programming in OCaml works), you will spend less time worrying about the language itself rather implementing the necessary concepts into the projects. You will *lightly* go over Rust programming towards the last 20% of the course which is a much more traditional language, and is primarily used to teach concepts on type safety. 

All in all, it is very manageable. I'm still salty that I didn't perform up to my potential in this course because I felt like I really understood what was taught but sold on the exams because I'm a nervous wreck and tend to blank out during them. Use the practice they give you (exams and quizzes dating back to the days where CS wasn't a 40,863 student per class major) and redo them till you can recognize the type of questions on the exam and can get instantly started on solving them. 

Also, Friday discussions were not it because wtf but they're worth it if you need the additional practice and sometimes you have to go because they give quizzes (they'll tell you when they are so don't worry). So go to discussion. Or don't.",3
"Only complaint is that he tends to mumble sometimes, so I would recommend sitting near the front so you can hear everything he says.
Solid lecturer. Makes the topics about as engaging as they can be.",3
"TLDR, if you have a choice between Anwar of Cliff, take Anwar (better overall lectures and more do able assessments).

Cliff personally made this course much harder than it was supposed to be. I usually ended up reading Anwar's slides and examples, and eventually, watch his recordings instead to understand some weird concepts like lambda calculus. Cliff notes made it insanely harder to understand and grasp it in my opinion. The way he designed his slides is just so not intuitive at all, and makes it even harder when he doesn't record his lessons. 

He has philosopher style of teaching, which makes sense because he got a degree in that. But honestly, teaching cs in that kind of style just makes it harder and more complicated than it's supposed to be for students to understand this class. And remember, 330 is a required class as a cs major, so yeah this matter should be taken seriously rather than a joke.

Now yes, keep in mind, 330 is a hard class (it's a 300 level course duh). So yeah regardless it wasn't going to be an easy class anyway. But I just felt like this course was insanely unstructured. They taught things too fast and concepts just felt out of place to grasp personally, especially when it's expected that many students are also taking this class with 351. I also felt like the projects were way too complicated and just weren't helpful in understanding the concepts that we learned in the course, especially project 5. And I also think we could've just learned Rust for the entire course rather than jumping into a new language after already a difficult language (OCaml) weeks before our final. Also, I despised the fact that the course used OCaml to teach us the concepts, honestly made things worse to click and understand...

I just felt like if they assessed things with more structure, and actually know what kind of questions to ask on the exams, the course wouldn't have been to hard. Because honestly, the concepts were actually darn easy to grasp, and some of them were pretty cool and essential too (e.g. NFAs/DFAs).",1
"Cliff and Anwar typically are the only people who teach this. Material is the same but definitely take Anwar over Cliff. Cliff's lectures are about as boring as can be. Imagine a theatre kid mixed with a introverted CS nerd. I would have rather watched paint dry than attend another one of his lectures as it would've been more entertaining and helpful than his lectures. His notes and slides are a mess filled with snazzy little transitions that make it a nightmare to navigate. The class overall felt pretty unstructured with random topics thrown in for the s and g's. At least Anwar recorded his lectures and explained things better than Cliff's philosophical mumbling. Material is difficult but certainly doable. Start project 5 early. TA's were hit or miss. I think there were maybe one or two good ones but the rest seemed to be pretty rude, unhelpful, or overall useless. My discussion TA was late half the time and spent most of the time arguing with one student about different ways to do problems. That's all I remember until I stopped showing up to the discussion at all.",0
"Good teacher overall. He's a boring lecturer imo but you can easily just not go to class because his pdf notes are very well-constructed and cover everything you need. OCaml is tough, and projects 3-5 are the hardest I've had in college so far. Thankfully, only 10-20% of each exam is OCaml coding because 330 is really just a ""intro to compilers"" course and the theoretical/non-coding topics are pretty easy. Rust is fine.


Choosing between him and Anwar doesn't matter. They share exams, projects, quizzes, and the course website, so just pick the better time.",3
"Cliff has a lack of professionalism that radiates throughout this entire class. He doesn’t hold his TAs to any standards so they often show up late and are unhelpful during discussions and office hours. He tries to be goofy by putting bizarre “brain rot” style questions on midterms, which obviously makes the questions way harder to comprehend. He also never responds to emails. On top of all that, he’s not a great lecturer. 

He’s not the Devil. I don’t want to be too harsh. But I struggle to come up with any positive contribution that Cliff made to this course that I can’t also attribute to Anwar. I would recommend taking Anwar instead.",1
"To be honest, I did NOT like Cliff as a professor whatsoever. First lecture was good, then it went downhill from there. All Cliff does is yap his mind away and it is very hard to pay attention in lectures because he has a very monotone voice and very boring slides. At some point, I stopped going to lecture, and even if I did, I would NOT pay attention. By the middle/end of the semester, there were only 50 kids in the lecture hall. His slides are alright, but tbh, Anwar's material helped me learn the material better. Looking back, the concepts in 330 are not bad whatsoever, just that Ocaml is so annoying to write. He has quizzes that were aight (first one was atrocious, avg was a 9/20). His exams were also pretty straightword, not many curveballs other than putting brainrot on questions that made the question so much harder to understand and solve. PROJECTS 3-5 ARE BAD, START EARLY. For these projects, he made them longer/harder because of cheating in previous semesters. 

Tbh, I might recommend anwar over cliff but it really doesnt matter.",1
Good professor. Easy exams with high averages and adjusted due dates on MATLABs and homeworks to accommodate the unusual situation the pandemic put us all in. He genuinely cares about his students and I highly recommend taking any class with him.,4
"Genuinely wants you to learn, is extremely organized (has some killer notes), is easy to talk to, makes expectations clear, and was accommodating and compassionate during these corona times.

If you really enjoy math and there are things outside the scope of this class that you want to explore then Fernandes is your guy. It is clear he loves math and he really cares that you learn. He is more than willing to talk math with you even if it is not something in the class.

Overall great guy.",4
"Professor Fernandes is one of the best professors in the Math department. I have not had a professor who was more concerned with his student's success. He made the linear algebra easy to understand, with his very clear and precise notes. Overall, Professor Fernandes is by far the best option for taking MATH461. ",4
he's such a sweet teacher and really understanding. I wasn't really sure about him because he didn't have any reviews for the class but he is a really great teacher.,4
"He was an amazing guy that answered everyone's questions to the best of his ability. He always provided students with ample resources and was open and understanding to students' concerns and issues throughout the whole semester. His exams were more than fair.

His R projects were hard at first but he adjusted the difficulty after some complaints. The weekly quizzes and hw's were kind of annoying. Some of the quizzes were sort of difficult but they were always multiple choice questions.

He was a great guy and truly cared about us learning however, I found it very difficult to learn stat from him. He didn't really emphasize the differences between different statistic concepts. The math isn't the difficult part. Its understanding when which distributions are used and what each of their qualities and downfalls are. Now, if I came to class I could've asked these questions but I was asynchronous and only watched recorded vids.

Not too hard a class, but difficult to learn the concepts from just the math text book and his lecture recordings.",2
"Great professor with great notes. Not only a good teacher, but also a pretty nice person. He has been very responsive to student feedback and made significant changes to the structure of the class based on it. Would definitely recommend.

A little note is that there are some particular small matters that upset him, so just be cautious.",4
"he's really nice and very willing to help students but i dont like him because he gives way too much hw and doesn't explain concepts very well imo

the concepts studied in stat400 are actually so simple but somehow his lectures overcomplicate them and make them difficult to learn. personally i have difficulty reading math textbooks so learning mostly from lectures took way too much time. He kind of just writes a bunch of numbers down and assumes you understand what he's talking about. sorry I dont speak math - im not a math major

I was watching lectures asynch tho so i couldn't ask questions. BTW he was SUUUPER open to questions and stopping lecture to answer ur questions.

he gives 1 quiz, 1 r project, 1 hw every single week. its so fucking annoying. chill tf out. the hw problems take so long, the R projects are annoying, the quizzes will hurt ur grade if u don't understand the concepts.

he makes an introductory stat course harder than it needs to be with an unnecessary emphasis on R coding
",2
"He's an amazing professor! He is very accommodating when there are legitimate concerns and truly cares about his students. If you ever need any help, he offers lot of opportunities to meet with him during office hours or before class (this is during COVID so all online). I have never done statistics before, but I have been able to do really well with this class even with it being all online. 
 Homeworks can be challenging sometimes, but he gives lots of time to do it and you can ask for help during office hours. R Projects are not hard if you go to his R-Mondays (help session specifically for learning R), and he usually records these. He provides notes online and records his lectures, so you can always go back to review. Hands-down one of the best professors, you can't go wrong with him!",4
"He's a decent professor who applied a very generous curve at the end of the semester, dropping the lowest exam, lowest two quizzes, and lowest two worksheets. The class itself is just very difficult and his exams are somewhat difficult. The weekly quizzes also stack up in damaging the grade and are pretty tricky. However, he's always very open for questions and records all his lecture. He also provides his notes. The class is definitely not an easy A or easy, but he's a decent professor for a hard subject. ",3
"He is a great professor, always very prepared, always willing to go the extra mile for students to help them succeed. Take his class if you can!",4
One of the best professors at UMD. Would 100% recommend to take his class. He is so accommodating and he genuinely cares about his students. I have never seen a professor care about his students so much. He gives you handwritten notes that are so comprehensive and really help with prepping for the quizzes and exams. All of his exams were fair and he handles online classes really well. ,4
"he's ok i guess. alot of his quiz and exam questions are poorly worded which makes it way harder than it needs to be. however, he clearly cares about his students and makes sure he tries to accommodate everyone that struggles. i have no idea how he will be in person though.",2
"Fernandes really cares about his students and provides everything they will ever need for their success. He provides excellent notes, help with the homeworks and R projects and even Guided Study Sessions with TAs. The content is decently interesting but he presents it in a way that is understandable and relevant. My only critiques with the class are the homework assignments. The homework assignments will be the most difficult thing you will do compared to the quizzes or exams. I really wish the homeworks would be more accurate the questions encountered on a quiz or test. Other than that he has very generous weights, provides a 10% buffer on each exam, and provides a bonus points curve. Oh and he doesn't do A-. If you have a choice take stat 400 with fernandes. 

Recently he discovered that some people were cheating, and so now he is making the final only during a select time period (rather than 24 hours like the mid terms were). I believe this is unfair towards the students who do take the class and their learnings seriously but I guess it is what it is. ",3
"If you have to take or want to take stat 400, take it with Fernandes. One of the best teachers and really cares about the success of his students. ",4
"Dr. Fernandes is truly the man. Great lecturer, and really cares about his students' success like no other. ",4
"I had Fernandes this past summer for STAT410 and it was his first time teaching the course. Usually students take STAT400 first before STAT410 but this was not the case for me. Fernandes did an amazing job explaining the course material I would say he's just as good as Justin when it comes to teaching. Also if you ever had questions about the homework, course material, or R projects you could do to office hours and he would walk you through it. He turned STAT410 from a difficult to easy course and was extremely approachable definitely easy to get at least a B and with a little bit of extra studying you can get an A.",4
"Nice guy, but terrible at explaining concepts. He wastes a lot of time in class getting distracted. His lectures are from the textbook, but he doesn't ever explain definitions, he only states them. He also expected us to know R without ever going over it in class.",1
"He clearly knows the content very well but is terrible at explaining it succinctly. He goes a long round-about way of explaining the material in a conceptual way that could be shortened by just giving us the equations since no one really cares about proving the equations. Then he doesn't test us on the conceptual stuff; he tests us on applications that he glosses over/skips entirely in class. The weekly worksheets (25% of the final grade) are pretty much impossible unless you have a good TA who explains the entire thing. The twice-a-week WebAssign homeworks (15% of final grade) are also very difficult, and you really need a lot of friends to figure it out together and to use all three attempts of each person to get to the right answer. He often doesn't finish his lectures during class and has to hold zoom make-up sessions or just posts notes he expects us to go through on our own time. He doesn't go through any/nearly enough examples for us to understand the topic. If you don't read the textbook sections before class and land a great TA, good luck. On the bright side, we had no quizzes, just the 4 midterms and final.",0
"Not the best at explaining concepts, but he's a very kindhearted and understanding professor. He goes out of his way to help students wherever they need help. He also grades things leniently gives many opportunities for extra credit. Tests are very fair - lots of practice materials are provided. I especially appreciate his decision to eliminate ""minus"" grades (he assigns grades of A+, A, B+, B, etc). Good choice for STAT400.",3
"An absolutely horrible professor. He shows up late to every single class and never finishes a lecture. He does not do relevant examples and always makes mistakes so nothing makes sense. He also gets easily distracted and wastes a lot of in class time. You need a great TA or you will fail, some TAs will explain the worksheets and some have no idea how to do them. The worksheets of which are basically over complicated challenge problems that he will not teach you how to do. Even if you've taken calc 2 before it is extremely difficult with him as a professor. If you read every page of the textbook and do every possible practice problems you might pass. Luckily there were no quizzes so your grade is mostly the exams... ",0
literally tragic the way this man teaches. often has technological difficulties and goes through long round about ways of explaining concepts that is not needed as well as doesn't explain everything that we need to know for homework. 10/10 do not recommend,0
"Look, he's a great guy. But he really struggles to teach. If you win the TA lottery, then you will get an A with ease since the professor likes to curve things with the average being based on his lackluster explanations. Otherwise, good luck. Good grade or not, you're looking at 10 hours / week of homework, 4 midterm exams (for some reason), and a whole lot of stress. I give my prayers out to whoever has to take this class (which, unfortunately, is every engineering and computer science major).",2
"My professor who taught me Calculus 1 at a community college easily trumps Fernandes ten-fold in terms of explaining the concepts and doing the examples. If you don't have a good TA, you are screwed. Going to UMD Math Success has been an integral part of me being able to pass this class, other than that, the tests are really difficult unless you are good at doing math problems quickly. He often has technical difficulties in class and always starts the lecture 3-5 minutes late. He rarely ever does examples, like what you see on the WebAssisgns and the worksheets, instead just talking about proofs and concepts rather than how to actually do the problem. The weekly worksheets are impossible unless you are gold-like or have a good TA. Overall, I've stressed more about this class than all my classes combined, and I do computer science for crying out loud. Overall, this is the only class I have ever taken where I am uncertain about it I'll even have a C at the end. Only good part about this class is that there are no quizzes and he is a nice guy. ",0
"He's a very caring professor, and it shows. His class is difficult, and for good reason. I would be surprised if it wasn't, it's calculus after all. The homework and exams are challenging, but never completely unfair. I will say that he sometimes does not explain complicated concepts well. Other than that, he's a good professor, and a good resource if you're willing to put in the work for yourself.",3
"I think a lot of the bad grades are from people who didn't expect the workload that comes with college and are unprepared to independently do well. It's a college calc two class - it's going to involve a lot of work and a lot of confusion. However, the TAs I've talked to are capable and even if yours isn't, you can go to any TA's office hours for help. You WILL NEED to go to office hours, read the textbook, and do extra work to do well in this class but that's the same for any math class you will take in college. If you spend this time learning the material, the tests will be easy as he makes them exactly like the homeworks. Fernandes does have some teaching flaws but he is a good professor and genuinely wants everyone in his class to succeed. If you aren't doing well in his class, you won't do well in any calc 2 class.",4
"This is a college calc 2 class so expect to have a lot of work and spend time everyday to do well in this class in general. Fernandes' lectures are kind of hard to understand so you will NEED to read the textbook and practice problems from there to understand the topics. He is a very kind professor and cares about his students, but the reason why I would say he is good is because his tests are very similar to the worksheets and hw. If you can do all the problems from the worksheets and hw you can literally ace every exam. TA's are also very helpful and answer questions really well. He is dropping our lowest exam.",3
"I give him two stars because he's a nice guy. He truly does care a lot about the students and the way he changes his grading policy throughout the semester shows it. However, please do not listen to these spur of 4-5 star comments coming out of nowhere. He is not good at teaching. It literally is a TA lottery and if you have a bad ta you are fucked. The lectures are useless because he teaches proofs and ignores doing examples that will help with the homework or worksheets. The worksheets are only completable if you to go discussion... they are pretty much impossible to fully complete on your own. He comes into class late every day and always gets sidetracked by random stuff. It can get frustrating and for a bit, I just stopped attending lectures.

Overall, He's a really nice guy. I would give him 3 stars just because of that but I don't know if I can because I have never taken a class worse than his in my entire academic career (I'm a junior). He just has no idea how to teach the course.",1
"TOUGH CLASS(in general)

this professor is very understanding and tries his best to teach in a way that helps students in the long run. I will say at first i was not a fan of this class but soon realized, its the material and not the professor. Jon has a great sense of personality and WANTS THE BEST FOR YOU. 

All you have to do to pass this class is go to class and try to be as active as possible, exams are fair, require studying and understanding, not just memory. homework is a little tough, try to find a friend to work through it, if you're lucky you will get a TA that basically does all of the work with you in discussion. 

I CANNOT PRESS THIS ENOUGH if you ever are struggling go to office hours, it helps a lot and is definitely pushed by prof. all of my friends who had other professors said they were swamped with work, this class is less work and more self study, so if you don't do good with self study do not take this class. 
 ",3
"He's great, but the class is hard. Curve is pretty generous (drop 1 exam and 2wks). Overall, his teaching style is fine, but you need to have a great TA to actually understand the wks and some concepts.",4
"By far the best professor I had this semester. He treats everyone with respect, and if you email him with a question he normally responds back in a timely manner. He was big on students not stressing out too much about exams or projects, so he made sure to adjust accordingly. I will say that he has a tendency to get side tracked in lecture, so be prepared for him to go on a few tangents. During the second week of class someone air dropped him a meme and he spent a solid 20 minutes talking about wasting other people's time...yeah exactly. Exams are fair(and kind of easy), and the homework gets more straightforward as the semester progresses. Homework assignments are long, but not difficult, and the quizzes are the reason why I will not have an A+ in the class. 
HIGHLY HIGHLY Recommend taking this course with Fernandes. ",3
"The professor focused a lot on the theoretical side and provided little examples, but if you put in a little bit of work outside the class and used textbook problems for practice the class is pretty easy. The sample exam is practically the same as the actual exam so learn how to do the sample exam and you'll be fine. Not a large curve on exams but dropped the lowest exam, 2 lowest homework worksheets and curved web assigns out of 90. If you are good at math you should do fine in this class.",3
"He is a really good professor with a great personality. He will try to help his students as much as he can. He listens to complaints and tries to solve them. However, you will need a support system for this class. Going to discussion and having some classmates to study with will make your grade. The lectures can be confusing since he is required to go over theoretical definitions but with the supplement of discussions, you will be okay. The exams are not difficult if you practice the sample exams. Overall, he was a great teacher with a great sense of humor and personality. He is humble and down-to-earth. ",4
"Jonathan is an extremely nice guy who genuinely wants everyone to succeed in his class. His lectures were pretty hard to understand for me but he uploads zoom recordings of them so eventually I stopped going to the lectures and just watching those which then evolved to me not watching them at all lol. I found it more helpful to thoroughly read the textbook since that has more complex examples to go over. Jonathan tends to just do proofs during the lectures and if he does do an example it's the most incredibly surface level example that doesn't really help you on the HW. I gave him three stars because I do think he loves his job and wants the best for everyone. Pretty generous curve at the end of the semester as well. Overall, this being my first class with him I think it comes down more to the work you do outside of class if you want to succeed.",2
"He is a good teacher and kind to his students. He is super generous !! Like súper!! You will do absolutely fine in this class if you actually do what you're supposed to: go to lecture, do your homework, and seek for help from him/TAs when you need it. You have to put your own effort in HOWEVER I know he doesn't write the finals himself but my God that was the most brutal final exam I've ever had in my entire life. Don't rely on the final to boost your grade bc damn. ",4
"Professor Fernandes is a good professor and an excellent person. He cares a lot about his students, constantly asking for our feedback and providing us with comprehensive web assigns and study material for tests. He also uploads his notes and lectures, which is very helpful. However, he can be a bit disorganized at times. Aside from these issues, I learned a lot from his class and it was great having him as my math 141 professor. ",3

I probably put 8x the effort in that course than any other course. he dropped one of our midterms, two homeworks, added bonus quizzes to help our grade, and curved the final. Even with all that, I barely got an A. Very appreciative of his care for students. I do recommend him, his class is very hard so read the textbook before and go to office hours, but if you put the effort in from the start you should be fine. ",3
"material is pretty challenging but Jonathan does a really good job explaining it. there's a weekly online quiz that's pretty easy if you just go to class and pay attention, and there are about 8 homeworks the whole semester. the hw's are fairly hard and take a bit of time, but the grading is extremely lenient. exams are also very similar to practice exams that he gives out. hard material but easy to get a good grade if you simply do the work he assigns",4
"Before you read any further, just keep in mind that the entire math department at UMD is doodoo, so I am writing this review with this standard in mind. 

About MATH141:
- This was the hardest class I ever had to take. I never had problems with math, and I actually enjoyed AB Calc in high school. But MATH141 in college made me hate math and question why I chose engineering. 
- I spent 12+ hours on just math each week, which was draining because you will have to self teach yourself a lottt of the material. You will not understand much of the material taught in class and the textbook is just as confusing, so Khan Academy and the Organic Chemistry Tutor will be your saviors. 
- The amount of work you have for this class is astronomical. You have homework assignments due after every class, which are a pain to complete. But one of the worst parts are the weekly worksheets. They are quite literally not possible to complete. If you do not have a good TA, you will fail these worksheets (and I say this because some of the graduate student TA's have zero clue how to complete some of the questions). 
- We had 4 midterms and a final. I think these were fair and the practice exams he provides, as well as the web-assigns, were good indicators as to what you should expect. Keep in mind that the average on these midterms ranged from a 62% to a 69% (and the final was sitting at a crisp 50% average). But at least we didn't have any weekly quizzes. 
- At the end of the semester, he applied a generous curve: dropped our lowest midterm, dropped two of our lowest scoring worksheets, curved the webassigns, and curved the final. This boosted people up quite a bit. 

About Jonathan Fernandes:
- I will start with the positives. Fernandes records all of his lectures and has zoom as option if you can't make it to in person class. He also posts all of his notes from class to Canvas. As a person, Fernandes is a kind and understanding individual who cares for his students and tries to make the class entertaining by cracking a few jokes (not to mention he has been listening to our advise and trying to improve his teaching). 
- Now onto the things which need improvement. I don't think he is good at explaining. I left every lecture confused, frustrated, and dreading my life decisions. I did not understand a single thing he taught in class, and he almost never finished his lessons (he usually accelerated to lightening speed in order to try to finish, and even then never did). Another thing which bothered me was the fact that he barely gave any examples in class in the beginning of the semester (he improved on this towards the end of the semester). He just went over proofs and the conceptual part of math rather than demonstrate how to solve the problems through examples. 

Good luck with MATH141 and say goodbye to your sanity in advance. My best words of advise will be to always expect the worst and hope for the best so that you can avoid disappointment as much as possible (be prepared to fail and know that it's ok). Hope this helped :)



and most of my grade is a compilation of my efforts to self-teach myself, the Organic Chemistry Tutor, and tears. ",3
"Jonathan was a great teacher and really amazing person. He helped me develop the joy for mathematics

some people who don’t love math might not like Jonathan’s teaching style since it is not about telling you how to use formulas, but more about deriving them and showing some basic proofs (he can over explain sometimes). Although this might be annoying to the people stopping at calc 2, it was quite refreshing for myself since it gave me a taste of what advanced math was like.


If you want an A+ definitely watch professor leonard on youtube in addition to showing up to his lectures. Doing this you’ll master the applications of the formulas (leonard) and expose yourself to more complex proofs that will be useful later in your math career(Fermendas).

4-5 times throughout the year he’d spend the first 5-10 minutes of class giving us life advice about how to succeed is college and life in general. He talked about being useful to your peers and such (giving not only receiving). He has really good dad jokes about math. funny guy.

The complaints about emails were quite valid. However, you can also see this as a learning opportunity. In work environments you will likely have many bosses who suck at replying to emails and need 2-3 follow ups.",4
"Dr. Fernandes is great!! I'd admit his homework and quizzes are kind of difficult(esp his homework, but discussion with the TA is basically a lifesaver for this). His exams are pretty much similar to the review and his class is kind of difficult in terms of learning the topics, but overall it isn't hard to get a high grade. Doesn't teach too well b/c he tends to focus on concepts rather than examples as well, which can be overwhelming especially when you don't know how to apply the concepts.",3
"Definitely some salty engineer/cs majors in these reviews. Just for reference, im a bio major (not very math oriented) and his class was fine tbh. Lectures are all recorded, so in case you want to sleep in one day u can always refer back to the recordings. Weekly HW’s were definitely hard for sure, but i don’t understand some of these reviews saying “bad ta= wont do well on hw”. One of the TA’s posted all discussion recordings on canvas (shoutout to jianlong liu) where he worked out essentially every hw problem. I just looked at his recordings and did the homeworks that way. Dr. F gives sample exams to every midterm, which essentially lays out the entire format of the test, so as long as you studied the sample exams, (Dr. F also gives solutions to sample exams) you were fine for the test. He also provided a monstrous curve for this class, and no +/- grades either which is clutch. Also, I may have just gotten lucky, but the one time i emailed Dr. F, he responded within minutes. This was at 2 in the morning also. Overall he’s a good guy, and i definitely recommend him to everyone. 
Note to rising freshman:
Just putting this out there cause I wished someone had said this when i was a rising freshman. But just make sure you understand that calc BC in high school is not the same as calc 2 in college, and you’ll have to put some amount of work in. I came into this class thinking it was gonna be a breeze cause of prior knowledge, but this class is only like 15% BC review, 85% new material. ",4
Dr. Fernandes is a good lecturer and he cares about every student. The course is fairly structured and he offers options for those students that want to seek beyond the knowledge of the course. Exams are fair and similar to the study guides he provided. Home works are challenging but the TA basically gives you the answer during discussions. R projects are not bad. Overall this was a very pleasant experience with Dr. Fernandes! ,4
"Excellent professor. Homeworks can be pretty difficult, but the discussion sections are pretty much dedicated to going over the whole homework assignment the day before it's due, so they're manageable. The exams were very fair and closely resembled the study guide and practice questions. R projects are generally pretty straightforward, and Dr. Fernandes records videos walking through each assignment in detail. His lectures can be a bit boring sometimes, but are supplemented by a number of very well made explanation videos that give a succinct overview of each concept. Overall, Dr. Fernandes is an excellent professor and I would recommend him to anyone who is taking STAT400. ",4
"Really nice guy, In order to pass this class you need to work together. Find resources that help you. His lectures aren't useless but they aren't the best content to learn Calc 2. HE IS THE BEST MATH141 PROFESSOR FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD. Good luck, you're gunna need it. ",1
"Fernandes is a very nice prof, and a bit unpredictable in a good way. For the midterm he said to memorize the distributions, then he put the list of distributions on the midterm. For the final he said to memorize estimators, then he changed his mind and made the exam open note. He has review videos online which match the lecture content. His lecture style may be difficult to follow but he spends a lot of time reviewing material throughout the semester. He also gives bonus quizzes for practice. He is very receptive to student concerns and helpful in office hours, he really wants you to succeed.",4
"If you want to learn the material, don't take him. Not great at lecturing, but an ""easy"" prof. No minus grades, which was nice. Exams were easy. Weekly homework solutions were given in discussion (before the hw was due). Weekly quizzes that weren't too bad. If you did well in CMSC250, you'll be fine with the first half of the course. If you've never taken discrete math, I don't know if he's the best prof. Really nice guy. ",2
"He was extremely nice and understanding this semester. Lectures could be a bit disorganized but he also has online recordings that cover all the material. Homeworks were tedious, but exams were quite easy and class average was very high.",4
Prof. Fernandes consistently showed up late to class. His lectures focus too much on theory and history of mathematical concepts rather than concrete examples. The TA you sign up for is CRUCIAL; my TA is the only reason I succeeded. Be prepared to teach yourself concepts outside of class. Invest in a full solutions manual to the textbook.,1
He's a great guy. Exams are pretty straight forward. HW is hard and quizzes tend to be hard. He doesn't mind changing his course policy if it benefits the class. A lot to memorize outside of distributions for the exams if you want to do well. Avg was around a 90. Beginning is going to seem hard but it gets easier. ,4
"Literally my favorite professor at UMD. I noticed that he got a lot of low reviews because of MATH141 in 2021, but for STAT400 you better fight with everything you got for a seat in his classes. He kept the class engaged and on schedule the entire semester, and frequently posted lecture notes, class recordings, AND asynchronous videos for people to review on their own. Homeworks are the hardest part of the class and will eat up some time each week, but TA's go over the answers for the homework at the end of the week before it is due. Additionally, forming study groups with other students helps as well for questions that TA don't review. 
Dr. Fernandes himself is easy to get in contact with and is amazing in office hours, he's willing to work through entire homeworks with students if they show that they are trying to put effort in learning the material (and not just there for a freebie answer, he spots the difference easily). In comparison to homeworks the exams and quizzes are super easy, especially because exams are the same as the practice exams that he reviews a few days before the exams. There's lots of opportunities for bonus credit throughout the semester so you don't need to worry about a few bad grades ruining your final grade. 
Definitely taking him again for STAT401 and any other class he's teaching.
",4
"The biggest thing about Fernandes is how big he is on ""hard work."" From R projects to homeworks to quizzes every week, STAT400 can be a bit draining. Fernandes is pretty theory-heavy in his lectures and tends to write pretty fast, and I personally think his handwriting is not the best, so I'd advise sitting in the front. The homeworks can be difficult, but going to the discussions is crucial in order to get these done. His exams are very similar to the practice exams that he gives out, so make sure to practice that heavily before going into the exam. The only really bad part about this class is the R projects. Fernandes gives R projects that basically ask you to do something but learning R takes some time and can be difficult as the IDE is also not incredibly user-friendly. There should definitely have been a guide released telling us what commands we are expected to use and the approach we should take. In my opinion, R was just very poorly integrated within the course. Nonetheless, Fernandes is an extremely nice guy who's down to answer any of your questions in OH and is accessible through email. And he does curve pretty nicely. Overall, I'd definitely recommend him as he's a good professor.",3
"STAT400 grade wise was not too difficult, the midterm and final was not too bad, as he does review all of the contents right before, and practice exams are very similar to the actual exam. If you just studied exactly how to do each problem on the practice exams, the actual exams are very straightforward. The lectures were very confusing to me, as he tends to go pretty quickly and his handwriting isn't the best, but everything is recorded on zoom and he posts notes as well. The lecture content is a bit difficult to understand conceptually, but if you watch the prelecture and review lecture notes it shouldn't be too difficult, to be honest, the most important lectures to pay attention to is exam review. The homework and the quizzes were probably the hardest part of the course, some homeworks were super easy but some of them were very challenging. Given how well you did in 141, you might want to review some calculus, as there is quite a bit of calculus in the homework problems and in the course in general. If you watch all of the pre lecture videos and attend all of the lectures, as well as discussion sessions, this class should be very straightforward. The midterm average was around 85% and 90%, so the grades are pretty high, he even drops the lowest hw and quiz grades, as well as awards bonus points. The RStudio projects aren't difficult either, the help slides are extremely useful and basically tells you how to do them. I even skipped quite a few classes and was not the best student, but I was still able to do well in this class. ",3
"Initially, you’ll have your doubts about this professor because you’ll feel lost during lecture often and you have weekly quizzes and homework that take up about 3 hours total to finish together. however, he’s an incredibly fair professor who was willing to give us two attempts on the quizzes and drop lower grades for hw and quizzes. His exams and final were also almost exactly like the practice exams which is great because as long as you comprehend the practice exam, you’ll be good for the actual one. I highly recommend his class!",4
"I didn't like him at first because he taught with a heavy theory approach but after I hunkered down and developed some intuition for the content, the class became a lot easier. The exams were straightforward and most of the class did well. The R projects (25%) are free points, and he gives bonus points at the end depending on how the class curve is. He expects 80% of the class to get an A and from the looks of it, we did. I plan to take STAT401 with him later, so I recommend him. It's not an easy A but if you put in a fair amount of effort, you will succeed.",4
"My criteria for a great professor is one that is fair and reasonable, great at teaching, and challenging. I know not everyone goes by these three criteria, in fact, most people probably care more about how easy a class is to pass than the actual content quality. To quickly address this for people who are wondering, this professor has a generally easy class as everyone else has been pointing out; as long as you do the work, you'll get the grade you want. If this is the only criteria I was going by, he definitely deserves a 5.

That being said, I personally try to take classes for more than simply fulfilling requirements or getting a good GPA; I think part of a good college experience is to take meaningful classes that are enjoyable. For those who feel the same as me, the following is a more nuanced answer to how I would rate Professor Fernandes.

As a person, Fernandes seems like a kind person. I have never personally talked to him but his flexibility and willingness to take input and dynamically adjust his class is something that very few professors do and this shows his care for his students. There were times when many students were behind in work and he extended the deadline. When it came to quizzes, Fernandes wanted to help students later in the semester by giving them multiple chances to finish a quiz. I feel that there are a lot of professors that do not care whether or not students succeed, just doing no more than needed. Fernandes is the complete opposite of this, wanting as many students to succeed as possible. This is something that I have to give huge props and respect for, however, this can be a double-edge sword (which I will explain at the end).

As for teaching, Fernandes is not the most engaging professor and as mentioned by many people, focuses mainly on theory. I won't nit-pick too much on the teaching of Stats because frankly, highly technical classes in STEM tend to be more boring. There are exceptions in Science classes where there are demonstrations, however, for the most part, STEM classes are boring. The professor's teaching style is something that I do have a slight issue with. On the one hand, I get where he is coming from; math, when deeply understood, can easily and be more intuitively applied to concrete problems. Deeply understanding math allows one to apply concepts more versatiley and creatively and even potentially develop new concepts. The truth is though, the higher and more complex Math becomes, the harder it becomes for the average person to 100% grasp theoretical ideas, which is necessary to apply concepts to concrete problems without examples. Also, purely teaching higher math in this manner to people who are not majoring in math and have no interest in math only dissuades students from learning and confuses students. It would be better if Fernandes focused half of his classes on theory and half on concrete examples to get the best of both worlds. Even if I am wrong about his teaching style, it is true that attendance steeply dropped, meaning students did not find his class worth their time.

As for my last criteria, I do not believe Fernandes is challenging. There have been comments below that his class is tedious and I totally agree; R projects were something that most people spent lots of time on due to unfamiliarity with R, homework and quizzes took up more than 3 hours a week for me, and the Final project was something that took up some time that was completely unnecessary. Tedious, however, is not always helpful to students and is not equal to challenging. First of all, I have no doubt that there was mass cheating in the class and the leniency that Fernandes had enabled this to happen. Quizzes could easily be shared between students and with multiple trials and multiple friends, most people probably got full marks there. Also, ultimately, Fernandes gave up to 5% bonus points as a curve(meaning someone that got a B+ could potentially get an A), which is exorbitantly high which I felt was giving out freebies. Tests were essentially the study guide with a few modified answers. The only thing that was truly challenging in the class was the homeworks, but it did not relate to concrete examples most of the time and answers were given out on Friday. I ultimately believe that if a class is challenging, hard-work and smart work should be rewarded. Again, I respect Fernandes attitude to help the most people, however, his grading and methods allowed many people to get a grade that is unrepresentative of their actual abilities. This is not only unfair to people who truly work hard to understand the content, but ultimately lowers the legitimacy of this class.

As a person, I have no issue with Fernandes, but with his teaching style and lack of challenge (which should not be confused with tediousness) I think there is room for him to improve. 

*Pardon my grammar, I did not feel like checking back

"I took this class over the summer and found it manageable and well organized. We had lectures every day, which were always recorded and the professor's notes were also posted after class. A short quiz was given every day and was available after class from 4 PM until 9 AM the next day. In general the quizzes had 3-8 questions and were a mix of multiple choice, true/false, and choose all that are true. You always had two quiz attempts, allowing you a second chance to learn the material and fix your mistakes. There were two homeworks due every week, these were the most time-consuming part of the class. I found them challenging but nothing too difficult. We also had three R-projects that we were encouraged to work on with a partner, these were pretty easy. To end the course, we had a take-home final. The grading breakdown was quite generous with a large percentage of points coming from quizzes and homeworks, the final was worth 10% of our grade. I felt everything was graded quite appropriately so long as you were actually trying. Prof. Fernandes was good at explaining things further when asked and clearly came into lessons with a plan. The whole class ran very smoothly and I will be going out of my way to take him again in the fall for STAT420.",4
"He's a pretty good professor and the class grade is distributed fairly. He goes over the concepts and examples during class. The practice exams are basically the same as the exams with different numbers. Just make sure to do the practice exams and know it all before the exam. Webassign is basically free points. The worksheets are graded pretty harshly so I recommend checking all your work and doing it thoroughly before submitting them. There is a curve for this class so don't worry too much about your grade.

I heard most of the other professors for MATH141 are bad so I recommend taking his class if you have the opportunity.",3
"I'm disappointed to write this review because I've taken STAT 410 with him and had a great experience. this class was insanely hard and jonathan's expectations for the students were definitely way too high. the homeworks were super hard and I always had to google to figure out how to do them since the class notes were not directly applicable. the exams were also insanely hard and we didn't get much help to prepare. for the final exam he told us ""if you know all the examples from class and homeworks you'll be fine"". like jeez thanks a lot. He also said he'd post class notes but would always do it super late, giving us barely any time to use them for hw/exams. Only giving him this rating because he's a nice guy and was fairly lenient with grading/curving final grades. not really sure what happened but STAT 420 was a pretty bad experience.",1
"Jonathan is nice and helpful. I really appreciate that he record all lectures. But the way he taught the class could be better. The contents are unclear and the hand-written notes are hard to read. The course itself is very hard and I hope he can give students better notes to learn. He does give very helpful practice exams but since many people never understand his lectures, it turns out we have to memorize EVERY SINGLE QUESTION which is very suffering. Exam averages are around 80/100. You can easily get 95/100 if you know all his examples and HW questions, but again, it takes a long time.",3
"Personality wise, he's a very nice professor and is open to answering questions which stay relevant to what was covered. Teaching wise, Fernandes' lectures more so focus on the theory of whatever lesson or chapter you are on, rather than explaining the process or concept then going into loads of examples. To compensate for this, the class is structured so that you MUST attend every discussion session to go over the worksheets; those are your key to passing this class, as they are filled with example problems. No quizzes, just graded worksheets, WebAssigns, and exams. Exams are extremely fair as the average for the last 3 exams have all been above 80s (about a 3 point curve for each one, except for the latest one we took we got a 6 point curve), so just do the sample exams which are given through ELMS and REVIEW THE WORKSHEETS. Fernandes also records all lectures, which is an added bonus. Luckily, I got an awesome TA (shoutout to Mengting Chao!), but depending on what TA you get it will either make or break this course. Just don't get caught up too much in the theory, and focus more on what's covered in discussion and you'll be good to go. Good luck.",3
"He is a nice professor, but his course is a mess. Starting with homework, he assigns homework with extreme difficulty with no relevance to lecture/quizzes/exams. Although we would take time to look at homework during discussion, it would only be enough to do 1-2 problems. So, when you go to complete the rest of the problems it is impossible unless you have a TA's help because there are no examples/resources available to help with said problems. When time for exams/quizzes you have no idea what you are doing because you spent time practicing something unrelated. I spent about 10 hours weekly to do homework!!! Also, the professor goes quicky through material and skips over defining important symbols/mini-concepts. The nice thing is that he posts lecture notes, however, they usually offer little meaning due to the lack of defining small things, lack of cohesion, and lack of relevant examples. We also have to complete R projects with little to no guidance on how to use the language. Attending his office hours are pointless, when I would go, he would have a hard time answering the homework questions. And because he has one of his office hours on the day the homework is due, when seeking help, he will not provide full explanations saying something along the lines of ""it will be hard to explain this completely if you wait until the last minute"". Overall, I spent 20 hours a week for his class (including lectures and discussions) and still preformed poorly. I spoke with classmates and I am not the only one. What bothers me the most is how his rating is 3.89. Avoid him at all costs!",0
"For the disaster of a class that is Math 141, Fernandes is probably your best bet. A lot of my problems with him probably come from the fact that Calc 2 is an artificially hard weed-out class that is designed specifically to destroy the soul of the students taking it. Fernandes however, turned the rat poison that is Math 141 into Coors light. It still tastes like shit, but at least it won't kill you.

The lectures started out well. Even though they focused heavily on theory (35 minutes of theory to maybe 10 minutes of examples), I felt like they were effective in helping me succeed on the problems we did in the discussion and the exam. However, Chapter 8 (Integration Techniques) and ESPECIALLY Chapter 9 (Series) were a nightmare. We fell behind quickly in lecture, leading us to focus almost entirely on complex theory with no time for examples. In fact, we didn't even cover in the lecture how to find the roots of a complex number, something that ended up being worth ~10% of our grade for Exam 4. This meant that our poor TAs had to teach us how to do all the practice problems.

Luckily, despite the mess that was the lectures, the tests were incredibly easy because they were literally just copy-pasted from the already fairly easy practice exam he gave us to study. This caused the test averages for all of the tests to float around the 80% mark, which is great considering the averages for all the other professors floated around 60-65%. I looked at Pilachowski's Exam 4 and it looked WAY harder than what was on our test. He also is a really nice guy. Despite the class having 200 people in it, he would make an effort before every lecture to ask us all how we are doing.

Overall, Fernandes is awesome if you just want to get a good grade in Math141. If you actually want to learn the content well from lectures, however, Chadwick would be better for you (although his tests are WAY harder so I'm not sure that trade-off is worth it). I'm giving him 4 stars because my grade is better than it would be with other professors, and I believe that most of my complaints come from the design of the course itself.",3
"Dr. Fernandes is definitely one of the better calc 2 professors to take from what I've heard, but definitely would not take him again. I took Chadwick first semester and Fernandes second, so here is my comparison of the two:

Overall, I learned a lot more from Chadwick than I did with Fernandes, and his teaching style worked a lot better for me. Chadwick writes on the chalkboard and goes over everything you need for every homework and classwork assignment. Fernandes, on the other hand, writes on his ipad and scrolls immediately when he is writing notes on the board, making it really hard to follow and write in time. Chadwick's exams are decently hard (I averaged an 87 for all 4) and Fernandes' exams were easier at first, but the last exam was very hard and was a curveball to all of us (the average for the class was a 68). The first 3 exams for Fernandes were extremely similar to the practice exam, so if you study the practice exam, you're good. Fernandes does teach too much theory in my opinion and misses the important stuff a lot. If you don't have a good TA, don't even bother taking Fernandes. My TA carried us this semester and I also found myself reading the textbook, watching videos, and attending office hours weekly. Fernandes consistently shows up late to class, and he never gets through everything we need for the homework that night, leaving us to fend for ourselves. At first, he was fine, but the second we got to more difficult material he would get confused or say our TAs are gonna teach us--but keep in mind we also had to do a worksheet during discussion so we don't have time for our TAs to lecture. The one thing I like more about Fernandes is that worksheets are due friday night, so there's less pressure to turn them in at the end of discussion. 

Finally, Fernandes does not offer a curve on exams at all, he does not even drop the lowest exam to half, so you really have to self study for this class. He considers an A+ anything over a 99, so you also have to score extremely high for that. All in all, do everything that you can to take Dr. Chadwick. He is a great professor and explains concepts really well. Definitely do not take Fernandes unless you have to.",1
"I did all the practice exams, homework's, quizzes (he gives 2 to 3 chances to retake quizzes to get best score), went to every discussion (except 1) and made an effort to go to every lecture and ask questions on the spot when I felt confused. We are given all the tools to pass this class and do well on exams, given the exams are nearly identical to practice exams he gives as hw assignments prior to the exam day. It just depends on how much effort you are personally willing to put in (outside of class) and probably who your TA is. TA explains the little caveats necessary to complete the hw's, so go to discussion! I had to work really hard outside of class to make sure I was understanding but nothing was really too big of a surprise/stretch to me because I have already taken a statistics class (that wasnt calc based), completed calc 1,2,3, dif eqs and lin alg. My strong math background definitely helped.",4
"TAKE HIM HES LITERALLY MY FATHER, he literally made the class so easy
Grade distribution was fire:
Worksheets: 25%
WebAssign: 15%
Exams: 35%
Final Exam: 25%
4 Midterms and 1 Final
Lowest midterm grade replaced with your final exam grade if you did better percentage wise.",4
"From hearing from other professors, Fernandes seems to be the best option available and I would generally agree with this. He records lectures and posts his lecture work for every single one which is very nice.

I had Mackall for 140 and Fernandes was a major improvement for me and I'm glad I switched. He is just overall better and more accommodating professor. I actually didn't feel like Fernandes was actively out to make me fail his class which is different than the other professors.

I'll discuss the content of the course now.
Fernandes has weekly worksheets (that he made himself) that are due every Friday that generally take some time to do but aren't impossible like Mackall's worksheets that have to be done by the end of the discussion. This leaves the discussion either to be your TA actually teach the content of the course or just go over the worksheet answers for you so your mileage may vary.

The grade distribution for this semester was: Webassign 15%, Worksheets 25%, Mid-term Exam 35%, Final Exam 25%

Fernandes exams are very similar between years so all of his practice/previous exams will give you a GREAT idea of what will be on the exam.

Honestly just overall, Fernandes gives you the resources to succeed if you try hard enough. No matter what professor you get, you will struggle in the class so in my opinion Fernades is your best way to succeed in the course",3
"Professor Fernandes is a great professor, and like those who share the sentiment, he's definitely one of the better MATH 141 professors. His instruction from the beginning of the semester started out strong, and so the first exam was relatively easy if you pay attention to class. However, as we shifted to more difficult content, the quality in instruction deteriorated. I became more reliant on my TA for help on topics, and because of their incredible response rates, it was easier for me to contact them than Professor Fernandes. It is known that he's unresponsive to emails and such, so to get the best opportunity to speak with him, stay in the lecture hall after class. Now, he doesn't use any chalkboard, rather his iPads. This makes for good and bad things. It's great because he's able tor record lectures, even broadcast them live on Zoom. Moreover, it's fairly easy to go back to content discussed in lecture. However, it makes for keeping up with him in lecture incredibly difficult as he scrolls away quickly. I spent hours upon hours on web assigns (homework), and he curves these at the end. Moreover, we're assigned weekly worksheets, which are also curved at the end. The exams were fair, and practice exams will help you.",2
"Seems like a great guy. Not a great teacher. I started skipping lectures a month into the semester because I realized I wasn't getting anything out of them. He was going too fast for me to understand, and my notes were getting so messy that they weren't even useful. My TA was very helpful though.

Last time he taught 141, I heard he dropped their lowest exam. This semester, he replaced our lowest exam score with our final exam score if it was higher. Just so you're aware.",1
"Not the greatest instructor but makes it very easy to succeed in the class by making everything easy, midterms were the same as the practice exams he provided just with different numbers. Also has a lot of questions in those midterms straight out of either the textbook or the worksheets he provides. Never went to the lectures as they were very hard to follow along, but the discussions were very helpful. I mostly learned from youtube/ textbook, and those were more than enough to succeed. 
He made the worksheets and the web assigns out of a 92, so if you had more than a 92% of either of those categories you were given a 100%. This was really helpful as they make up for 40% of your total grade. 
He is literally your best bet if you want to get a good grade in this class.",4
"Jonathan is pretty middle-of-the road as far as UMD math profs go; you could do better and you could do worse. I got an A and I’m not exactly a math genius, so that’s saying something.
Pros: worksheets and WebAssign homeworks are a relatively large portion of your grade, and get curved. Also, you can take worksheets home with you and submit them online at the end of the week, so you don’t need to rush during discussion. All midterms have a 3-point curve, and he gave an additional curve on one exam because he accidentally included a problem that was way too hard.
Cons: tends to arrive at lecture late and run over time, so leave yourself some wiggle room. Sometimes as he is doing problems he scrolls away from something immediately after writing it, so you have to write fast or have a friend you can copy from if you miss something. He also doesn’t always get through the entire content of the lecture. The worksheet problems are usually different/harder than the lecture problems so you have to hope your TA will explain everything.",2
"He is a super chill professor and really wants you to succeed. He added a three-point curve to all our exams and curved more if necessary. My lowest midterm grade was a 98, without taking math140 first semester. This was truly just due to doing the practice exams and the additional practice questions the TA's sent out. If you go to discussion and ask questions, you'll be fine. I was scared of taking this class, but Fernandes made it completely digestible. Definitely go to office TA hours though!",3
"He is great, his lectures are not the best but his amazing TAs make up for it so does the exam review lectures because they set you up well for the exam. His exams are far more doable than some others I have seen. If you practice and utilize the time you get with TAs it's possible to do really well.",3
"Great, reliable professor. As far as UMD math professors go, I think he's one of the best options. Homework was manageable, exams were pretty much exactly like the practice exams, and he gave a lot of resources. I had a horrible professor for MATH140, and I went into this class with the same expectations but was pleasantly surprised. I definitely fumbled on the 4th exam and the final, but had it not been for those exams, I would've easily gotten an A in the class.",4
"Jonathan is a great guy but a not-so-great professor. His lectures are disorganized and often confusing, and I recommend not going to them since they're recorded. My TA was amazing, which helped a lot. Worksheets were due at the end of the week and could be done anytime within that timeframe. Exams were slightly curved, and the lowest exam score was replaced with the final score if it was better. He even curved the worksheets and the webassigns. Its easy to get an A in his class so long as you have a good TA.",3
"Jonathan is perfect I would say. He posts all the lecture videos and notes in elms. He had one worksheet for a week that we were to submit online. So no need to appear in the discussions. But I recommend going there because TAs (Garrett) are helpful. They will make you walk along with the professor. Exams are fair enough. Just do worksheets and previous exams, and you will be fine. Exams will be way easier than worksheets though. He curves a lot, so don't worry about grades at all.",4
He is great.,4
"1. Homework: First questions of hwks are easy, but the last ones are medium to medium-high difficulty. Make sure you reference his Scribbl notes, and attend discussions to ask questions to TA. Most likely TAs will give you hints or go over ""practice problems"" which are extremely helpful. 
2. Exams: 80% of the exam comes from sample exams. Questions on the exam tend to be simpler (IMO) than the sample exam. If you want to get a good grade on the exam, ***DO THE SAMPLE EXAM AND GO OVER THE QUIZZES AS WELL***. Most likely he will draw T/F or conceptual short answer questions from the QUIZ. 
3. R Projects: R1 was a bit work, but for later projects, professor gave us sample code that you can just copy and paste from. Check out his shared google drive for guidance on R. 

Overall: Prof Fernandes is pretty chill; he is graceful on hwk/prj extensions. His scribbl notes are step by step organized and helpful to understand and tackle hwk problems. But I have to say my grade hugely relied on my TA who helped students during discussions.",4
"The first half of the semester really deceived me. Homework was doable, and the first exam was genuinely copy and paste the sample exam, even though we did not have access to a calculator. But then things suddenly shifted once the second exam came around. For the first exam, he went over the entire sample exam in class and discussion, for the second one, he only went over a few in class and the rest were just in the air. Mind you, these questions are a lot harder and it's tough to conceptualize without seeing an example of it. I had to go on a scavenger hunt to find answers, some were in lecture notes and others were found in homework answers. I even had to scan through answers from PREVIOUS YEARS to find close answers. The worst part is the second exam was not simply a copy and paste from the sample. 
Now here comes finals, he posts a sample exam with 36 QUESTIONS!!! and does the same thing he did for the second exam. He expects us to find answers & examples through his lecture notes and homework and all over. Overall a very frustrating exam experience. Knowing that his exams are derived from his samples (he even tells us this), it is all the more important to have some sort of answer sheet explaining some of these questions. The questions are typically one of a kind and were only mentioned once or twice on homework or lecture so often times students don't have a full grasp on how to apply their knowledge to such problems. 
He is overrated simply because he curves, but do not expect this class to be easy (don't let people fool you like they fooled me)
TAKE MESTIYAGE, HE ALLOWS A CHEAT SHEET AND CALCULATOR!!!",0
Awful teacher,0
"This course is actually really interesting, primarily covering topics such as hierarchical models, markov chains, samplers, and poisson processes. Fernandes's lectures were pretty good in explaining the concepts in each of these topics. During the semester, he was also very flexible with due dates and exams (asked us when we wanted the midterm and when we want to turn in the take home final). Homeworks in this class weren't too bad, although Fernandes would sometimes put typos on his homeworks that would make them impossible to solve (he addressed this on elms or in class however). There are R projects and a final project in this course, both of which basically ask you to write code to simulate a concept learned in class. Overall, I'd recommend this course, but it does have room for improvement since its Fernandes's first time teaching it.",3
"He is a genuine guy who cares about his students. His exams, quizzes, and homeworks are not meant to trick you just test your understanding. A great professor and guy all around, its worth getting to know him because he is so passionate about teaching and getting students to understand/ grasp the material. 100% recommend",4
"Nice guy with a generous grading scheme, but lectures are not engaging and notes are hard to follow. The midterms were fair and representative of what we learned, but the final was unnecessarily difficult and was mostly based on content that was taught in the last few weeks and not very thoroughly. The average on the final was 120/205 total points but the score ceiling was lowered to 180, still an average of a D. To be fair he gave us a sample exam that was representative of the real thing, but even though there was a collective student effort to make an answer key there were some questions that nobody came up with an answer to.",2
"Jonathan is a nice guy. He curves quite a bit, and he is open to feedback. My only problem is his lecturing style, since I feel like he says a lot of nothing half the time, though to be fair there isn't much to teach in this course. The TA was very helpful as well. She made some of the more difficult HW problems much more manageable. Overall, the first half of the course in my opinion is harder than the second, but it was still pretty easy as long as you put in enough effort.",3
"Stat400 and Stat401 have changed in difficulty with Jonathan. If you are reading the reviews about his practice exams being exactly the same as his actual exams, that is not the case anymore (for Stat401 at least). So if that is the reason why you want to take him, then it's not gonna fly in Stat401.

He is a really great professor though and the homeworks are done by the TA in discussion. I will say that the first part of the course up to midterm 1 will be a little daunting but once you get through all of that and really study the notes and do the homework, it will get better and you don't really have to worry that much about all the things in the beginning of the course once you get to Hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and Linear regression (Although if you didn't understand anything from the first part then you're gonna be lost on some topics that will be considered trivial by then). 

Content wise, this class was much more interesting than Stat400. I really enjoyed learning the content because it was really applicable whereas in Stat400 it was ""Here's a bunch of distributions and find the cdf"". I really didn't understand what a majority of the concepts and symbols in Stat400 were used for until taking Stat401 when that actually had to be used for something.

His exams sometimes have poor wording which is pretty stressful in a timed environment. However, if you study the notes and understand them and make a good note sheet for the exam, then you should be okay and you'll figure out what's being asked. If you are studying last minute and not putting time into this class thinking you can do the practice exam and be good then you're taking a big risk. There are conceptual questions on the exams that you'll only really know if you study the notes and pay attention to things he emphasizes in lecture. 

The TA this semester was not very good so I ended up using ChatGPT as my personal TA who could answer a majority of my conceptual questions so I didn't have to deal with her. Also, argue points back on exams if you think the TA took points off for wrong reasons. Jonathan will give you the points back, especially when the answers that were marked wrong are word for word quotations from what he said in lecture.

So if you were ever wondering what the point of all these jargon terms like ""CDF, Chi-Square Distribution, Degrees of Freedom, etc.. "" are used for, you'll learn in Stat401. It'll show that Statistics is a pretty interesting field of study.",3
"A great guy who runs a decent class.

His homework starts out pretty easy but progressively gets pretty difficult. The R projects are just modifications of old ones you can find if you look hard enough. His exams are okay, they're very similar to the practice problems. His final, however, was god-awful. He gave 36 practice problems for the final, only maybe 20 of which had some solution (somewhere). They were compiled from various homeworks and he refused to post a collective solutions document leading to students scrambling to find them and ultimately having to band together and make a collective solutions document. While this was incredibly annoying and made studying much more painful that was nothing compared to his final. His final was longer than he told us it would be, far more weighted towards the newest material than he promised. Within 15 minutes after the final about 40 people were begging for a curve (which he did give) on piazza. He later also lowered cutoffs.

Something should be said about how nice of a person he is outside of writing exams. He often made funny parallels to how the material could be applied in the real world, gave motivational speeches, and genuinely seemed to care about our mental health and well-being. Take stat with him but do not underestimate his exams.",3
"hes a great teacher. doesnt record his lectures, but hes taught stat400 online so he has a bunch of youtube vids you can just catch up with. he runs a scribbl notebook for lecture notes. very understanding professor and will accommodate as needed. online quizzes and homeworks are kinda timed weirdly, so weekly homeworks are due at noon on wednesdays, and online quizzes are available between noon and midnight on fridays. DONT GET VIBE CHECKED. IT SAYS 11:59 AM, NOT PM. also, hes super super super nice. during the week that the stadium suicide happened, he extended homework and project deadlines by a full day and made a public scribbl for people to write encouraging thoughts. massive W.

so why the 4 star and not the 5 star? well, his exams are very fair, but whereas some other stat400 profs allow student-made cheat sheets, he provides u with a single formula sheet with the bare essentials. plus, exam questions are homework/quiz/practice exam questions with the numbers or details changed. ok, not too bad. what's wrong? well, for our final, he released a 36-question practice exam. sure, a lot of great review material. the problem: the exam, made of 9 questions (he announced there would be 7 or more beforehand) was almost half based on content covered in the last 2 weeks before the final (he said there would be 2 or more questions on this material). ok, not the worst, right? because all those questions were on the practice exam? 

no! the exam was mostly made of the HARDEST variants of the HARDEST questions on the practice final. i have never seen so many people look defeated after an exam. the entire class flunked this final SO BADLY that not only was the final exam grade curved *10%*, the frikin final grade distribution was curved by at least 4% (i know, because i passed with a 66%). so, minus a star for giving me a heart attack, jesus christ wtf

(apparently he was really busy and the TAs may have had more of a hand in the exam than he did)",3
"Excellent Professor! He teaches clearly, records lectures, and does everything to make a comfortable environment for his students. We had two midterms which were 105 points worth of questions, but he entered the final grade out of 100, effectively giving a 5-point curve. He made the final exam with 210 points worth of questions; he was going to enter our final scores out of 200, but upon further reflection and request from students, he made the final out of 180 points, effectively giving a 30-point curve on the biggest portion of our grade! 

Also, he provided a sample exam before each major exam in this class, and 80% of the content from the sample exams was put on the final exams, with minor modifications. Admittedly, this class is difficult and does require a couple of hours of your time every week, but Jonathan does expect a level of hard work from his students. 

Homework: Homework is a bit difficult, but the TAs basically show you how to solve each problem in discussion, so it is important to attend discussion. 

Quizzes: We also get weekly quizzes on Friday, but they are online and you are given one attempt to retake it, which is pretty nice. 

R Projects: We were also given 4 R Projects across the semester, which are pretty easy, but tedious. However, TAs are very lenient with grading and this should be an easy 100 if you do the assignment and submit it on time. 

Overall, I think Jonathan provides all the necessary tools to succeed in his class. Yes, there is some work and some difficulty in the class, but Jonathan has an expectation from his students and expects them to meet it tox succeed in his class. If you do the work and study well for exams with the sample exams, you should be fine. He is very open-minded and will provide many opportunities for his students to achieve the best grades possible. 

At the end of the semester, we received additional curves on all of our assignments (Quizzes, Homework, R-Projects), another indication of Jonathan's generosity and willingness to help. Overall, if you work hard enough, you will succeed.",4
Execllent professor! Generous curves on each assignment and even exams. He listens to his students and is very open-minded!,4
"His class requires a lot of work, and the weekly quizzes that open and close on the same Friday were particularly inconvenient. His homeworks are the most difficult parts of his classes, so getting hints from discussion is important. His lecture style also was hard for me to follow, personally, and I found that skimming the textbook helped me grasp the content better than any of his notes. However, he did allow cheat sheets on his exams this semester, and doing well in his course was overall manageable as most of it was a matter of applying the correct formulas/hypothesis tests to the correct problems. As a person, he is nice and fair, and this class as a whole was rather tedious and full of busywork but not too demanding or difficult, so I would probably take him again if given the choice.",3
"Boring AF, explains poorly, HW hella long, gives identical practice exams to real exams (but they are HELLA long, esp practice final had like 36 problems). Literally got carried by TA's who did parts of the homework for us, parts of the practice exam, and explained the content in 1 hr a week. He had to curve final exam by ~10%, . His curves make the final statistics look good, but this was harder than CMSC330 and CMSC351. TA's came in clutch, and the class was survivable, but it was by no means a free A.",1
"Excellent Teacher! Truly cares about his students. He provides plenty of review before exams and provides us with all the necessary materials in order to succeed his class. Yes, the exams are difficult, but Fernandes expects a level of hard work, especially when he is providing all of the materials to succeed in his class. His review exams were basically 80% of the actual exam, which was a huge plus! Overall, great teacher, great person! Recommend!",4
"He doesn't explain the big topics very clearly sometimes, especially the derivations for type 2 errors. He wants to explain things intuitively, but sometimes, his explanations aren't very intuitive. And because of this, I don't have an as deep of an understanding on certain topics as I would like. I think the class could also benefit from more in-class concrete examples on how concepts are applied (we were taught concepts with no examples, which was very difficult for me), and it would also be helpful if he spent less time in the beginning of class reviewing what we did the prior class (it would occasionally take 18 minutes out of the 50 minute class). But some of the positives to his class are that he lets us have cheat sheets during exams which are extremely helpful because I think memorizing all the formulas is trivial, he records all of the lectures which is tremendously helpful, and Fernandes is also the nicest guy who genuinely cares that his students and he emphasizes prioritizing learning over grades. He also tells occasion stories that I find interesting and he also connects to you on a deeper human level occasionally when he talks about the privileges of education that we have and how we shouldn't take it for granted. I have a lot of respect for him as a person and as a teacher, but there are some aspects of the class that he could improve on while continuing to teach this class.",3
He often makes mistakes in his work and it’s genuinely hard to understand him. He’s not good at explaining things and the lack of empathy for his students…,0
"Super funny and nice guy, who cares about students learning the material well. Understand how to do the homeworks and examples from class and you will be fine for exams. One thing is he is not very responsive on Piazza or by email, but other than that he is great.",4
"His lectures do not cover much of the material on the homework at all. The TA's explain most of the material. I learn more from the TA's than the actual professor in this class. Whenever I try to contact Fernandes through email he is always unresponsive, and when I ask about it in person he acknowledges that he saw the email and asks to meet during office hours. A simple reply email would have resolved my questions. Leading up to exams, the procedures are always unclear, the TA's cancel office hours often, and just a very non-empathetic professor overall. It does not feel like I am being taught statistics, I am just being taught material that would help me pass the class.",0
"The class is so free– he gives 90% of the test material in the study guides for the test. Has a tendency to overexplain. Homeworks are challenging but help to prepare you for the test. Quizzes are bullshit but they're online and you have multiple attempts. Also, this guy does not respond to emails",4
"This class would be fine with a different professor. Content-wise it's not that bad if you study. However, Fernandez was really hard to understand and never wears his microphone so it was impossible to hear him in lecture. Everyone stopped showing up halfway through the semester. Not an easy A, but manageable.",2
Learned more in discussion then I did in lectures. Take it if you need it but be prepared to teach yourself the material essentially.,2
Much of the content that he goes over during lecture has nothing to do with the homework and exams. His TA's do a lot of the teaching. He has no empathy for his students and puts a facade that he really knows what he is doing when in reality he doesn't know at all.,0
"Pros:
1) Lenient grading
2) Exam questions are mostly from homeworks and quizzes.
3) He's funny in lectures, and you can see that he's passionate about teaching.
4) Records lectures, and also hosts them live on Zoom.
5) Has lots of office hours.

Cons:
1) If you can't do a problem on one homework, you're kinda screwed because he keeps asking you that for the rest of the course. So be sure to go to office hour and clarify it.
2) Extremely disorganized about uploading assignments. Made most of them due in the last few weeks which made it very stressful. Arrived late to class for most of the semester.
3) Speedran through some of the big topics of the course towards the end of the semester while spending a good chunk at the beginning reviewing Stat 410 material.
4)",1
"Let me start this by saying Prof. Fernandes is a great guy, super chill, mildly funny, and jerky like most math professors can come off as. With that being said... based off his teaching style and behavior during content dissemination, it became clear to me that he has never taught a 100 level course before, which makes sense as most of his previous reviews were of his STAT400 level courses. STAT400 and STAT100 are not the same thing, one is a early intro class and another has students that know what their doing, because he has only ever taught in that environment he reflects that in his teaching of STAT100. He's not bad but you'll definitely have to take advantage of your resources.",2
"Lectures were barely useful and slow paced. The home works and weekly quizzes had questions of which there were no examples gone over in class. He gives broad strokes of a concept and then expects you to figure out hard questions. In general he takes this class way too seriously for just a major requirement. Disclaimer: writing this review because I wasn't allowed to turn in a homework late, so I am a bit mad, keep that in mind.",1
"Makes a simple gen-ed class for mostly non-STEM majors as hard as possible. He curves exams by 5 points, but it is not enough. A LOT of homework, with crazy deadlines (due 2 days after assigning). We had 3-4 homework a week. He also makes you learn a programming language called R, but doesn't let you use R for the exams. 

He has the curse of knowledge, he lectures like students have the same understanding of statistic as him, a PhD. This class was unnecessarily stressful. He also sends out exam reviews that look nothing like the exams, he loves to throw curveballs.

You will have to heavily rely on TAs to understand concepts. He did allow students to do missing assignments on Pearson, so that one nice thing he did.",1
Wasn't interested in the material so this class was boring and tedious. Homeworks were long and required much more work than I had expected for this class. However Fernandes is extremely generous with grading.,2
"Incredibly mediocre. I appreciate how flexible with the course structure he is (Live Zoom recordings is great) but man this guy cannot organize a class for his life. It is genuinely so painful taking STAT420 with him since every homework or R project had numerous errors on them that were fixed a day before the deadline. He also just does not keep his word on anything. For the last 7 weeks of the semester, he kept talking about how he was going to release quizzes and then just forgot to and never did. He also honestly doesn't seem that familiar with the material himself and as a result does not teach this material in a way that is easily understood. Almost everyone in the class genuinely had almost no idea what he was talking about towards the end of the semester.

The saving grace for him is the fact that his exams are so ridiculously easy. If you can do the homework and devote time to memorizing the solutions before the exams you're pretty much guaranteed an A in this class. I would take Fernandes again if you don't really care about the material and just want an easy finish to your math degree. Otherwise, if you're looking to get an easy A, this is probably as easy as it gets for your 1-year sequence in your math degree.",2
"Very interesting and funny professor in class! I really enjoyed his jokes, and he made the content quite interesting. I do wish he spent a little less time working on STAT410 material in the beginning of the semester, but other than that, I don't really see many problems with this professor!",4
"As a person, this guy cares about his students and tries his best to make sure everybody succeeds. He deserves two stars solely based on his teaching, but I gave +1 because I failed the final but passed the class with a B- lol, generous curve.
As a professor, explains topics pretty poorly/confusingly. Hard to follow at times. Exams are usually fair, practice exams are very (very!) helpful.",2
"He is very nice and generous, but his curriculum and notes could be structured better.",2
"I'm very conflicted about my reflection on Dr. Fernandes.  On one hand, overall, the course was pretty fair all things considered.  On another, of all the classes I took this semester (3rd year comp e major credit-wise, so I'm not exactly taking trivial courses), this one was the one to seem never-ending.  Ultimately, my rating leans slightly more positively, though it doesn't necessarily correspond with a recommendation.

First of the good in this class, this course is not one to hide class material.  Lectures are recorded, lecture notes are readily available, and TA's practically give away some homework answers during discussion.  Of these, I only really utilized the lecture notes, as I didn't find the lectures to be very useful, and I wasn't going to my 8 AM discussion if I didn't need to.  I mostly learn by struggling anyways, so this may have been to my personal benefit, though I do recommend getting a discussion time you'll actually go to if you have the choice of time (I didn't).

The three semester exams were pretty easy all things considered.  There's built-in leniency on the exams, which led to fairly high grade distributions, especially for the first two exams.  The exams may have been a bit too easy in hindsight, especially compared to the final.  On top of that, we were given a review sheet for each exam, in which 80% of the questions on the actual exam were slightly modified versions of the review sheet questions.

Finally, we were curved a fairly decent amount in the end of the semester.  Originally, total homework and quiz scores were capped at 95%, and after the final, they were further capped to 92%.  If you did better on the final than your lowest semester exam, your final score replaced that exam.  The final was originally capped at 200 points, but it was further capped to 190.  This is among some of the most generous curving I've been made aware of in any of my classes.

Now, after all that, this class probably seems great.  I have three major reasons why my fairly positive rating doesn't come with an emphatic recommendation.

We had 3 R projects throughout the semester, with 1 being due each month starting in the middle of March.  All of these are miserable.  It doesn't help that R is my least favorite language to write, but even disregarding that, the assignments are overly long and didn't help me understand the content of this course in the slightest.  I do think that simulation is an important part of understanding statistics, but I got infinitely more out of making crude Python scripts to verify my homework answers than I ever did doing the R projects.  I'm not sure exactly why, but I think it's because most of the assignments were so mindless.  When they weren't mindless, it's because I was trying to make the plots not look like garbage, as the plotting functions are horrendous to use, and the default plotting behavior generates unappealing results.  In short, when I had to think, it was entirely on the wrong thing.  Since the assignments were so long, only these frustrations really stuck out in my head, and everything else faded out of my brain as soon as I was done each R assignment.

Speaking of that, the assignment distribution throughout the semester made the class seem never-ending.  Most weeks, a homework was due Thursday, and a quiz on ELMS took place on Friday.  The first R project was due on the Wednesday before spring break, the second one was due the Thursday after the second exam, and the third one was due on the last day of classes.  This assignment structure was a pain throughout the entire semester, particularly in the beginning and end.  In the beginning, the assignments took unreasonably long for no reason, especially considering that I had taken CMSC250 before this class, and the first third of this class's content is a repeat of the last third of that class.  In the end, I was just about ready to be done, but the assignments just kept coming, culminating in both the last homework and the last R project being due on the last day of classes (this homework was the only one on estimators, which is a problem I'll cover shortly).  There was never a break.  For a majority of the semester, we didn't know that our total homework score would be capped at all, so for all we knew there was no leniency to slack on a single one.  It probably doesn't sound that bad here, and it probably isn't if you're sane.  However, I took 15 credits of STEM classes this semester, and this is one of two classes which kept me tired across the entire semester.

Finally, the final.  Oh boy the final.  We were actually given the most resources to study from, with a supplied review sheet and the Fall 2023 final exam.  I didn't find either of these very helpful, since the former was far too long given that I had 4 other finals and a project due during finals week, and neither were given answer keys to let us know if we were in the right direction.  None of the past review sheets had answer keys, but that was mostly fine, as it was pretty easy to check whether we were doing things right for the content in those exams.  Meanwhile, much of the final was on estimators, which we already didn't have much practice with, so I found that I didn't really know much of what I was doing with regards to the overall topic going into the final.  I was mostly able to do the problems relating to homework 10, but there was a question on the final on something I literally haven't seen before the moment I was taking it.  Some of it I was figuring out literally while taking the final, and frankly it was miracle I got the score I got.  The rest of the class wasn't so lucky, as the mean was 60% even after the point cap was lowered from 200 to 190.

Overall, know what you're getting into when taking Dr. Fernandes for STAT400.  While things are overall pretty fair, the class nearly drove me mad this semester.",2
"Fernandes made this class harder than it should have been. He was also very unresponsive to students, not enough office hours, you did not learn anything from the hws as the Tas just gave you the answers. While the exam distribution was good I would not recommend taking him. The final exam had 34 questions to review, way too long. Average on the final was like a 60. Take someone else. Trust me.",0
"Just bad in every way. If you actually want to learn something, don't waste your time.",0
"i believe i should preface this by saying that i took this class during a very heavy semester, and entered with no prior knowledge of statistics. that out of the way, i think that while fernandes tries to make his class as accessible as possible (livestreamed + recorded lecture, real-time access to his notes, and quizzes being online so the discussion session can be used for going over homework), his overall approach to this class makes it frustrating. in my opinion, he's not a great lecturer; he spends most of his time lecturing about theory, and trying to make concepts ""intuitive"" by deriving various formulas (which i personally thought was unnecessary, since these formulas he derived were always provided for us on exams). his homework is then applications of the concepts he taught in class, and the ta's are supposed to go over them in discussion. i'm not sure if this was my ta using weird approaches to problems or just the difficulty of fernandes's homework, but many problems required rather unintuitive tricks that for me, made them more memorization based than actual knowledge based. he also didn't post answer keys for any of his homeworks; his ta's created them, but the quality of them varied (some were incomplete, were uploaded only a few days before the exam, or skipped many steps without explanation). he also provided a sample exam for each midterm (usually just homework problems with slightly different numbers) that he didn't provide answer keys for, but since most questions came from the homework, that wasn't a huge issue. it only became an issue for the final exam, which had a 50% average pre-curve and a 60% average post-curve. in the days leading up to the final, the piazza was filled with questions about different problems on the sample final exam, almost all of which were left unanswered (fernandes tends to be unresponsive via both email and piazza). besides homework and exams, we also had 3 r projects which were tedious but straightforward, and 10 online quizzes which were pretty easy (and you get 2 attempts for) all in all, if you have prior experience with stats, fernandes is a great option (he ended up curving out homework grades and quiz grades), but if stat400 will be your first stats class, i would be careful with taking him",1
Overrated professor who doesn't care. Makes the learning process harder than it should be,0
"This class was basically a disaster. He is not a good professor but will have good reviews because his classes are easy. simple as that. you will not learn much in this class. Exams are straightforward enough, but his refusal to go through sample problems is so annoying and makes exams much harder than they could be. The final exam was an absolute disaster. Lowest average I have ever seen. This is because he makes the majority of the final consist of problems from the last few weeks of class, which were so so so much harder than the rest of the course. I cannot stress enough about how bad the final was. He curved it a lot and adding overall course curves, but this does not help the feeling of complete despair going into and during the final exam. Take him if you just want to get through this class because its required, but dont expect to learn much or feel like you ever have a good grasp of the content. Really frustrating that reviews are so high for a guy like fernandes.",1
"STUDY A LOT FOR THE FINAL!! I had a 97 in the class walking into the final and walked out with a B+. HW's take a long time, but TA's go over them in discussion. My TA was bad and only went over like 2 of the problems each class so I just showed up to another TA's section. Exams are like the practice exams, but there is no answer key provided for the practices, which makes it harder. The averages for exams 1, 2, and 3 were all above 90% and then the average for the final was a 115/210 (55% - raw score). The prof only curved by 10% so the average ended up being a 115/190 (65%), on an exam worth 25% of your grade :/ Overall, midterms aren't bad, I got away with just studying the night before - but DO NOT do that for the final!",1
"Awful Professor, comes off as arrogant and stubborn. Makes the learning process unnecessarily hard by assigning R projects (which don't come with any supplemental resources).

Often makes mistakes on quizzes, making it difficult to achieve high scores without some sort of trial and error with the multiple tries

Overall this class felt like a lot of hard work but without any payoff. The homework was mostly copying down TA solutions, and he isn't the strongest lecturer. He provides handwritten notes that are written on the spot, making them disorganized and unreliable. Overall am surprised how he still has 3 stars, but recent reviews have accurately described his teaching for stat400",0
"The course is well laid out, if you do the work, it is easy to get the grade you want. I am saying this as someone taking statistics for the first time. 

The exams are hard, especially the final, and talking with other folks, this is something that has changed for Fernandes' classes over the last two years. However a practice guide was provided for all the midterms and the final (had between 20-36 questions), and he worked out EVERY problem on it in class and the review session he had right before the exams. If you came to class and kept up with the class notes this would be obvious. 

If you think this is going to be an easy A in an overloaded schedule, I suggest you not take this class with Fernandes.",4
"Evidently, he's gotten worse over the years, based off more recent past reviews & my experience before switching to a different professor after the first week. The last decent thing about his course (online quizzes) has been taken away in Fall '24. Instead, you have one in-person every discussion. I know that isn't so bad by itself but add that on top of the fact that he has the worst R projects and apparently a horrible final (again, see reviews from the last couple semesters). His first ""homework"" was actually a quiz that you complete in the first discussion instead of getting a week to do, as claimed in the syllabus. This was also the second day of the semester, so it was a truly wonderful start to the class. In addition to blindsiding us, the quiz had nothing to do with statistics, and instead included Calc 3 content. Calc 3 is not a prerequisite for this course and was not covered whatsoever in lecture. My TA wasted half the discussion time making everyone introduce themselves instead of letting us do the problems we were about to be graded on and also incorrectly stated that this quiz was not going to be graded for accuracy. Newsflash: it was. Fernandes just shrugged off how misleading and sabotaging he and this TA had been and even doubled down by claiming he was being lenient. Yikes.",0
Pretty bad lecturer but his exams are copy pasted from the study guides he gives. He says he acres and wants students to learn not just get a good grade but it often felt like he didn't care. Unresponsive to emails at times and can be dismissive if he does respond.,0
"Took STAT420 and MATH410 at the same time, Fernandes is honestly the GOAT for any STAT class. His exams are mirror copies of the homework, and will NEVER give you anything on the exam that you haven't seen before. He spends a lot of time helping you look at the ""bigger picture"", and helps you solidify your understanding of the statistical process. He's great. Class is trivial.",4
"Awful teacher, can't teach and gives exams that don't test what we learned",0
"I shouldn't have listened to everyone telling me this was a free A. No class has ever made me feel more stupid and miserable walking into every lecture after the first month and made me feel worthless as a student. I thought his teaching was ok, which is why he isn't 1 star, and the TAs covered homework problems in discussion, but I feel completely blindsided by his class. People told me only calc 1 material was used, but he uses calc 2 & 3 in his class as well. Please take someone else if you can. It's close but I'm probably going to fail because his final exam averages have been really low.",1
"hes my goat everyone giving him shit deadass just has a skill issue at this point
do his homeworks, study for quizes and this is the easiest A of your life",4
"This class is the best! If you go to class and discussion, do the HWs before the quizzes, and do the study guide before the exams you are set up for success. Ask for help if you need and dont fall behind. He is also super nice and personable and could not recommend taking STAT400 with him more!!!",4
"I understand the frustrations towards Fernandes as I did not expect to put a ton of time into his class, and admittedly, I've struggled. His lecturing is okay, but the rest of his class is generally organized. The homework is covered in discussion + weekly quizzes, but those can take a really long time. His practice problems will prepare you for the midterms, which aren't bad, but it can be easy to mix different things up or forget formulas. For some reason, we did not have any R projects this semester. I don't know if that'll stay the case. Mengting has been super helpful as a TA. Sana and Mestiyage are easier options for STAT400, but Fernandes isn't bad until the final exam. Just don't expect the class to be super easy. 
If you struggle or don't get the material, seek help from the TAs or Fernandes. It'll hurt your grade if you don't. 
LEARN Double Integration and PREPARE a lot for your final.",2
"Jonathan's lectures don't really relate to the homework or exams. With that being said, it is not too hard to get an A in this class. The exams are very similar to the practice problems he gives, and the TAs will go over the homework in discussion. We had weekly quizzes in discussion but they weren't too hard and my TA always went over how to do the problems before the quizzes. Honestly shoutout Mengting I love you thank you for getting me through this class.",3

Fernandes is a decent lecturer and was very approachable, but STAT400 is not a course to slack off in. It will become your most time-consuming course (unless you're taking CMSC351 at the same time) when approaching the final because of how Fernandes writes his finals. Fernandes is a very decent teacher, with lectures being comprehensive, but his notes don't really help unless you're sick and missed a lecture. The course itself is light at the start, but becomes increasingly heavier as time goes on, with the material AFTER Exam 3 (which you had 2 weeks to learn) being very much the heaviest. 

Before we talk about the final, let's talk about everything else.
Gradewise, you have:
10 Homeworks (20%)
10 Online Quizzes [Not anymore, it seems] (10%)
3 R-Projects (10%)
3 Midterms (35%, total)
Final (25%)

The homeworks were rather easy, though one of them required knowledge of what a double integral is (which you don't really need Calc 3 for in all honesty). Each homework is easy enough to figure out using online resources and Fernandes' notes, but do require thinking. The quizzes were honestly hard and eventually turned into a guessing game since you were given two attempts for each quiz. Fernandes gave small but significant curves to our total homework and quiz grades, helping students who may have hurt their grades with them. The R-Projects were the easiest but most tedious part of the class for many people, including me, especially because it didn't really help us with anything. 

Moving on to the exams, Fernandes gave us good practice exam problems and material that helped immensely with exams. I will say that I didn't fully use it for the first exam, leading to me getting a 51, but they were able to get me As on both exam 2 and 3. Fernandes also replaced your lowest exam with the final grade percentage if it was greater than the lowest exam's score, which is the reason I have an A in the class.

However, the reason I am writing this and giving Fernandes such a low score is due to the final. First off, 50% of the final was comprised of the info we had learned in the last two weeks of the course, with the rest being cumulative. The problem with this is the final two weeks of the course contain the hardest concepts out of the entire class and the lectures for the last two weeks were the least comprehensible by far. Second, he threw a curveball question that was buried in the final practice questions and which we have done only once on quiz 2. Third, the list of exam questions he gave were so long that I couldn't even finish it after 20 hours of studying, with my peers giving up long before I had. Fourth, one of the questions we HAD only seen on the practice questions and no one knew what the hell we were supposed to do with it. All in all, this accumulated in an average final score of... 54%, the upper quartile being 68% and the lower quartile being 41%. This absolutely RUINED many people's grades. I knew a guy who walked into the exam hall with a 97% and ended with an 84% in the class after the final exam curve, which was only 20 points off of the 210 point final. I knew people who ended with a C in what should've been an A course for them. My only saving grade was me studying for so long that I pulled off an 83% (which would've been an average grade in nearly every other STAT course besides Jiang's). If you plan to take the course with Fernandes, make sure you're focusing on the final throughout the course, as impossible as that seems. 

[And if you're taking it right now, good luck, you'll need every bit of it.]",1
"Homework were graded leniently and were bad though time consuming.
Exams were pretty much the same as the practice exam making it pretty easy to score above 70% even if you didn't spend too much time.
Quizzes were hit or miss. Some TA's gives out the topic of the quiz which makes it much easier to study for (mine didn't so occasionally got questions that I wasn't prepared for and bombed a couple quizzes). Usually similar to one of the homework questions.
No R projects anymore which is a huge plus since I'm not a big fan of R.

At the point of writing this, I haven't taken the finals yet. I heard Fernandez have hard finals and a majority of it is on content that we learned in the last two weeks. I also heard that he curves heavy so that might balance out a poor final.",3
"Honestly he’s not terrible or the worst but he’s the most unhelpful lecturer ive ever had. All of his lectures consists of definitions and proofs, no actual problems whatsoever. If his exams were a vocab test i would have an A+. His exams vary on difficulty but the final was insane. He gives us practice problems leading up to the exams but refuses to give any sort of answer key. I felt clueless studying for this class because I wasn’t sure how to derive my answers or if they were even correct. When you ask him to explain any of the problems he’ll usually just give some random equation and tell you to “figure it out”. If you have a TA you should be good for the homeworks and quizzes (i love you mengting) but the exams take up a huge chunk of your grade. His lectures were just incomprehensible at times and he barely took any feedback. Overall, it’s not impossible to pass this class with him but if you have a better option I wouldn’t recommend taking him.",1
"[Taken Fall 2024]

TLDR: DO THE REVIEW PACKETS. ALMOST EVERYTHING ON EXAMS (including the final) COME FROM THE PACKETS

Fernandes is a pretty solid lecturer but there can be times where he doesn't explain the concept too well and it gets confusing so you have to do a little work on your own. The course also starts out really easy but don't let that trick you... it starts to ramp up fast and unless you are on top of things you will struggle. Seeing the difficulty of the homeworks would worry students but the exams would always be directly from the review packets (numbers changed). Also you don't really need to worry too much about quizzes (your TA will most likely give you a heads up on what it is about, and the questions themselves are pretty easy). Fernandes is just a really chill dude and he curves well. He also adjusts quiz and hw scores to help students (out of 93 percent instead of out of 100 percent).

Beware: the last two weeks of the course make up 50% of the final. Don't be caught lacking because I did and I had to work really hard to even score a 91% on the final.",4
"Overall, I'd recommend Fernandes for STAT400. He genuinely wants students to succeed and has expressed multiple times that he wants every student to get an A. He has weekly quizzes and weekly homeworks, but they're very manageable since his TAs go over the answers to homeworks in discussion before they're due, and my TA showed us sample problems similar to the quizzes right before we took them. His lecturing is fine, not particularly rousing or boring.

One thing to note: as an ADS student, he was a little difficult to work with. He wants ADS students to start at the same time as the class, and will email you to ask why you're taking it at a different time if you start early or late (which no one has ever asked me about, ever). I almost had to take a makeup final exam because he wasn't willing to budge on timing for the final, despite the scheduling issues not being my fault. He's willing to work with you under extraordinary circumstances, but it wasn't a typical experience accommodations-wise.",3
"[Taken Fall 2024]

This class is very time-consuming and requires a solid understanding of Calculus II, Calculus III, and some Linear Algebra. Make sure you are comfortable with these subjects before taking. 

His office hours is great for clearing any confusion with any concepts covered in lecture. He posted all his notes online on Scribble and uploaded recordings of lectures. Homework assignments were assigned weekly and graded leniently, though they were very time-consuming and often contained typos. Quizzes were also weekly and proved challenging, often requiring memorization of formulas introduced in that week's notes. The exams were very manageable if you actively reviewed the notes and diligently worked through the homework problems. I just wished he would release answers to the homework problems. It's difficult to fully understand what you've done wrong from just a grader's note and having access to the correct answers after the homework has been graded would be beneficial. I also wished for some practice exams or study guides to help focus our preparation on specific topics. Even a study guide that altered homework or quiz problems slightly would have been beneficial. Not having any study guides is what made the course harder than it should have been. The course also did not have any R projects, which was nice.

Fernandes, I know you're reading this, so here's a cat for your due diligence in reading these reviews:

  > ^ <",2
"Fernandes is a nice guy, but I am obligated to inform people that this course was somewhat of a nightmare. I know he reads these reviews, so I hope he can at least hear out the complaints.

The Bad:
The organization of this class was abysmal. Near every homework and exam had a question that was outright wrong/impossible to solve on it. Even a quiz was printed wrong and became impossible. It was hard to even submit homeworks because he would not open submissions on gradescope until oftentimes after the assignment due date. It was unrealistic to reach him via email. He would at best take 4+ days to respond from time of email and at worst not respond at all. On that same topic, NOTHING was graded on time. Every homework, quiz, and test took close to 2 months to be returned to us. It was difficult to gauge how well you were doing in the class at any given time for this reason.

Some homeworks were extremely tedious and did not enhance learning. Many had problems that were exactly identical except for one tiny parameter change. Others involved tasks as tedious as enumerating 64-event sample spaces. A lot of them involved incredibly difficult integrals and other problem-solving techniques that were not addressed during lecture.

There was a random quiz difficulty spike with no warning. The first 3-4 quizzes were easy and required no studying until a certain point where every quiz essentially required memorizing the previous week's class notes in full detail. This transition point caught many off guard and resulted in quite a few low quiz grades. 

You are given absolutely nothing to study for exams with and barely any information about what the exams will look like (except for the final where we got a list of topics around 24 hours before the final itself). Also, it is worth noting that the final had a median grade of 63% for probably related reasons.

He moved slowly through topics in lecture to the point where I could not stay on his wavelength unless I watched the lectures in 2x speed. However, this is probably more of a personal complaint.

The Good:
He posts the lecture notes online after every lecture and records every lecture via zoom. These are godsends. His office hours are very helpful too, and he is approachable. 

Despite the terrible organization, he often did end up correcting his mistakes, like correcting the quizzes and homeworks with erroneous questions. There was a curve where if you got 93% average on the homeworks and 90% average on the quizzes, you got 100% in each category. This somewhat made up for the rough transition. I also found the midterms and finals to be manageable if you were thorough about going through all the homework problems and in-class notes.

To summarize, this class was way more of a headache than it needed to be, which is a shame because he does a lot of things very well in this course.",1
He is a solid professor overall. He records all of his lectures and explains concepts pretty well. Honestly the recordings are more useful than the lecture itself since he lectures pretty slow and it doesn't fit my style. There were quizzes every week but they were easy and doable. The homeworks were also good and some of them were time consuming but the others were fine and pretty easy. He gives study guides before the test and if you practice the questions in them that is 80% of the test and you should be fine with the exams. Even without them the exams are straightforward and if you know the material you should be fine. Sometimes he is unreachable or does not update the material or communicate on time but overall he is pretty good.,3
"This class is pretty fair until the final. There are 3 midterms, 10 quizzes, 11 homeworks. We were told there would be projects to do in R, but they never were assigned. The midterms were pretty similar to the practice exams that were given. If you took the time to understand how to do each problem and had a solid understanding of the concepts, you would likely do well on them. Quizzes were slightly difficult at times due to Jonathan not giving any information about them beforehand. They were often similar to the homework so if you were able to finish the homework 2-3 days before it was due you would be fine on the quizzes. 

The worst part about this class is the two weeks after the 3rd midterm. Jonathan decides to introduce the hardest topic in the class which is pretty hard to self-learn and his lectures on the topic are not very good. Half of the final are questions on this topic so not having a good understanding of it will tank your grade. We were provided with a 42-question practice final which was very difficult compared to what we had been doing for the entire semester. Ultimately, I ended the class with a B after going into the final with a 95. 

If you decide to take this class, start doing the practice final as soon as it comes out. Learn how to do all 42 questions and commit them to memory as difficult as it may seem. You will have to collaborate with classmates to see if you are doing these problems right as Jonathan does not provide answers until a few days before the exam and even then he will only provide a few answers. Don't make the same mistake I made thinking that a solid A going into the final gives you any kind of security.",2
"[Taken Fall 2024]

If you just go to the classes, do your homework, take quizzes and exams honestly, you'll get an A for sure. 

The only beef I have with his class is that he suspected certain people were being dishonest in his class and he made the homeworks wayyyy longer and it was so timetaking that we had to spend a spend a day or two to just finish those assignments. Again, they didn't get tougher, just longer. As someone who didn't cheat, it felt so unfair and doing those assignments just drained the soul. He should've reported the misconduct instead of taking it own on the entire class. And man, just for this, I don't dare take this guy again (I want 7 days in my week, not 5).",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He makes all of the worksheets and assignments ridiculously time consuming, and he just post screenshots of the textbook and barely explains the topic. He will go through example questions just to use rules and formulas that he has never even talked about. He will then assign questions that are way too hard compared to the lecture. He is the worst math professor you can take.",0
"A disorganized mess of a class. Homeworks, worksheets & lectures do not match one another. He comes either 2-5 minutes late to lecture every time, makes minor mistakes which students have to fix him for, or goes off on tangents with formulas & topics a huge chunk of the class never encountered. Constant expectation that we should know XYZ. On the first exam, only 2 of the 5 questions were on the review sheet. Heavy self learning class which it shouldnt be. Most of the class is baffled, going to tutoring and struggling. DO NOT TAKE. AVOID AVOID.",0
"Very self learning heavy teacher for only calculus 1, his lectures arent helpful and are usually one topic behind what is assigned on the current webassign, his teaching is so bad that I actually havent learned anything from a single one of his lectures and the TA for the class has been the only one to be able to coherently explain the topic and how its applied, first day of class some guy asked whether or not the textbook was necessary, Jonathan danced around the question giving a ""it would greatly help"" bs answer despite some webassign questions straight up just asking you to use equations from the textbook's practice problems. Scared to see that he teaches calculus 2 as well when he has piss-poor teaching like this for only calculus one.",0
"For the love of all holy please do not take Professor. Apparently this is his first time teaching 140 which I get it is hard and rough but this man’s class is so disorganized. The discussion worksheets take ages to do, the web assign /cengage is broken and tanks grades, he posts the exam practice sheets the weekend before the exam giving little time to prep, expects us to know concepts of the bat, his lectures are always behind what’s on the homework. 
His class is extremely self teaching so avoid if you aren’t a fan of that sort of teaching style.",0
"You are going to be fine with him. 

Bro records his lectures, posts his notes, TAs work through worksheets during discussion, he stays over after every lecture answering questions about worksheets and Webassign for as long as you want, and even records this portion for those who cannot make it to the lectures. The exams are literally picked out from the problems covered in lectures and discussion worksheets. 

I went to his office hours after my poor performance on Exam1 (turns out he reached out to multiple students who did poorly on the exam) and he was patient with my difficulties and suggested different study strategies, which have since helped me bounce back. 

Surprised by the 1-star reviews this early in the semester. Instead of venting here, go talk to him in office hours and get the feedback you need to succeed.",4
"Does a lot of examples in class. Worksheets take are hard and take time, and I told him that. Very helpful and encouraging, will listen to feedback, and is willing to implement it whenever possible. He moved Webassign due times because many students asked for it.",4
"I don't understand the hate here. 

You just have to 
(1) Go to lecture, 
(2) Go to discussion 
Make sure you you can redo the problems covered in (1) and (2). Some of the problems are hard, but I don't mind them.",4
Interesting lectures. Pretty cool class.,4
"The guy is a little disorganized but he really does care for your success in the class and will stay to talk to you after lecture to answer all of your questions. Sometimes there will be typos on worksheets (that the TA usually corrects in discussion) and he will give a class-wide extension for his mistake. As long as you don't completely bomb an exam (like less than a D), you will be saved by your worksheet and homework grades. They're time consuming, yes, but they serve as good review for exams anyways. The TA will walk you through 1 or 2 problems in discussion so you only have about 3 problems left when you go home. As others have said, he's really not all that bad. Just go to lecture, discussion, and if needed office hours. You'll be fine.",3
"I took him for both stat410 and stat401 in fall 2024. Bottom line: if you're looking for a significantly better chance at an A than you would have with any other professor, take him (just look at his grade distribution). If you're looking to get the best possible understanding of statistics and probability that you can get, maybe look elsewhere. He's honestly pretty lazy, doesn't do the best job of explaining the content, often makes mistakes during lecture, assigns fairly difficult/time-consuming/tedious homeworks, and his quizzes vary between being really easy and really hard. The reason I took his class and gave him 4 stars in spite of all this is that he gives the most generous curve I've ever seen in a stem class.  As long as you do all the homeworks and study for quizzes/exams like you would for any other class, you have a very good chance at an A, something that cannot be said for anyone else teaching this class most semesters.",3
The professor realy break it down for us. The class is though si you need this kind of profesor who love what he is doing. He was very patient to answer all my questions. Will recommend 100%,4
"Professor Fernandes isnt the best at actually teaching the material, but he does make this class enjoyable. He cares about his job, and will always answer any questions you have. The exams are just like the practice exams, and the discussions are very helpful. You dont really have to go to lecture, but i recommend going to discussion. Throughout this class, I only went to discussion and have done fine. The worksheets and webassign homeworks can suck and are normally much harder than the exams, but the TA's help out a lot with those. The grading for exams are also very generous and you can get a lot of points even if you make many mistakes. Overall, if you keep up with the content and understand whats going on, this class wont be any trouble.",3
"Im not someone who understands math very easily and jumping into this course from high school was a little difficult because Im used to my professor teaching me every little thing to know, instead of reading the textbook and studying on my own. That being said in the beginning I did not like this class at all, but I have actually come to love it! This is because I used to be someone who never studied and got away with it, but now through studying on my own time for a little bit, this class is actually extremely easy. The exams are just like the practice exams, and he pulls problems either from the worksheets you have already done or from the problems he goes over in lecture. The TAs are the ones who will walk you through how to do the problems. 
If you go to lecture and do the worksheets (which are very normally finished in class), and review for maybe 2 hours before a test, this class will be an easy A. 
The TAs are very generous with points on exams, if you show you know how to do a problem but have a wrong answer, you will recieve most of the points.
Exams are normally curved, and worksheet grades and exam grades are adjusted at the end of the semester. This class is a very easy A, even for 
someone like me who doesnt really enjoy math, but can understand concepts after studying.",4
"This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He does not accept questions about the subject and, on several occasions, has told students that they were stupid or that “I didn’t expect this class to be such idiots” during lectures. Take another professor: DO NOT TAKE HIM",0
"If you ave a background in calc and are looking for an easy A I wold take this class. I took calc in high school, didn't attend lectures/discussions but the exams are exactly like practice exams and everything is curved at the end.",3
"Overall, the course is pretty difficult, but keep in mind that homework and web assigns will be significantly harder than the actual exams. He's not the best teacher, so I personally didn't go to class, but everything is recorded, so if you can solve the problems from the worksheets and the problems he does in class, you will be just fine. Also, make sure to utilize the office hours of all the TAs for the course because some are significantly better than others.",3
"literally the worst prof I've had here, doesnt teach things relevant to homework and exams, his lectures are him in his lala land talking about either really simple concepts like how 1+1 is 2 or its him going into way too much depth with variables and terms nobody knows because he didn't teach them. Absolutely no instruction on homework and exam material. It's like he assumes you've taken this class before. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. There's not even a textbook, there's a draft to the book he's writing that legit has an error on every other page it's comical how terrible this class was.",0
"As someone who struggles with math and statistics, this course truly helped me appreciate both the mathematical background and the practical intuition for many of the concepts that were thought ... while I found most of his lectures very engaging, I particularly liked the way he explained bayes theorem. The lecture on covariance and linear relationship was fun too ... if you connect with his style and humor,  the lectures are pretty nice and worth going to.   

His exams, especially the final is admittedly hard ... but he covers all the content and solves many of the problems during lecture and discussion (he has some of the most amazing TAs!!!). If you go to lectures and redo the examples from there, and the discussion, you should have no problem with the exams. Also, he adjusts the grades at the end of the semester and allowed for one homework resubmission, so as long as you are consistent with your work, you will be good!

He also records all his lectures, and live streams his notes ... which was very helpful for me.",4
"On the whole I would recommend this class. 

It is a hard class, and he expects you to work on the content. People say Stat400 is an easy A, but it was not the case for me. I did have to put a lot of effort, and the class is generally well supported - with him going over concepts and examples during lecture, and TAs working on homework problems. Somehow he has really cool TAs who go out of their way to help you!

He has in-person quizzes during discussion - which I did not particularly like, but he allowed for students to take make-ups within a week if they missed any. Just because of this I would take one star off, but then the 1-star review below me (from 05/20/2025) is flat out lying to the point that I am wondering if this person was somehow going to a different lecture all all semester long - so will give 5 stars!",4
"Note that the grade distribution is rather high. The class is an extremely theoretical version of STAT 400 and expects you to have a good knowledge of Calc 3 and Linear Algebra as they are pre reqs. His workbook he thought through made him zip through material making it hard to keep pace and the homework problems are rather hard but work with friends and go to Office Hours. 

His organization  of the class is horrible, posting homework very late and only releasing the practice exam one day before. They are roughly 60-70% to the actual exam. He decided to use a different textbook than the one that is used for the course. Races through concepts which makes it hard to keep up in lecture, but he posts his notes and records. Handwriting can be hard to decipher at times. 

Taking this class with the heavy CS Workload make it hard but is definitely manageable had I put more time towards the class to get an A after the curve. Class needs tons of work. 

Would not take with him and suggest Anna or Mestiyage as I have heard there classes focus in a more practical approach.",1
"This was a challenging class. For someone not used to studying for a college class, it took a while find my footing the class. 

He has two weekly worksheets that were due, and the TAs went over them during discussion. The exams were mostly pulled straight from stuff from lectures and the worksheets. Even the final was not that bad for me. 

I would totally recommend Fernandes, with the caveat that you will need to work - I am sure these study habits will last for the rest of my college experience.",4
"Like others have said, this is a typical Calc 1 class ... it is hard, and requires lot of work. 

What I really liked taking with Fernandes was that he required us to submit our worksheet solutions (from which he sampled some of the exam questions), there were 20 or worksheets each with anywhere between 6 - 10 problems ... looking back at the semester, I see that I ACTUALLY wrote solutions to more than 150 calculus problems ... this has really boosted confidence, and makes me believe that I can do anything if I systematically break it into 160 smaller pieces ... Calc 2, I am coming for you next!",4
"Good guy, he genuinely wants you to learn stuff in class that's why his course content is a bit harder than the other STAT 410 professors but the class is well structured with lecture notes, zoom recording, and workbook that you can count on even if you don't go to the lectures. He is genuinely passionate about teaching unlike many other professors and who just lecture in and leave. It is going to be an A if you're willing to put in the effort and if not you can surely pass through his class even if you don't go the lectures because of all the content he uploads.",4

"A solid professor overall.

It may not be as easy as STAT400 with Mestiyage from what I've heard, but nonetheless I think that Fernandes was a solid option for this class. Granted, his exams (particularly exam 2) can sometimes have some curveball questions, but they are generally related to what he teaches in class and especially related to the sample exams that he uploads, usually in a timely manner. I will say that his lectures were not the best, as his teaching style was a bit boring and he can sometimes be all over the place in his lectures, but they're not the worst and some office hours with the TAs will most likely clear up any confusion you have.

One thing to note though is that his final had some pretty hard questions, as about 50% of it is based on material from after Midterm 3, which is probably the hardest part of this course, which is the only reason he's getting 4 stars here and not 5. However, I would still recommend taking him as the rest of his class is generally not that bad.",3
Overall good teaching. One big complaint though. Towards the end of the semester he all of a sudden announced some sort of down curve capping the Homework and Quiz average to a 92% in offer for the final replacing lowest midterm. I personally am not a fan of artificial down curves/capping and it was very unexpected. I wish he had announced this much earlier or did something that felt less forced. Only complaint but overall the class is taught very well with adequate resources provided to prepare for exams.,1
"Jonathan is a fairly decent lecturer and a really good dude. However, I sometimes felt his lectures went a little fast or were difficult to follow. I suggest sitting close to the front if possible. The most useful thing is going to discussion. My TA, Amandeep, was the best I have ever had at my time at UMD across all classes I've taken. You really learn what you need to know in the homework, and just do the practice problems he gives for exams, and you'll do okay. I certainly could've gotten an A if I tried harder but I was more focused on not failing 351 and prioritized that unfortunately.",3
"Outside of the (outstanding) help from weekly discussions with my TA, I had to self-learn this course entirely.

My main gripe with this class is the lack of materials. There's a textbook that isn't particularly helpful, as it just goes over theory, and some videos that dictate that textbook. Outside of your TA, you're left with nothing to finish the weekly homework. Although he provides lots of practice questions for exams, they come with no answer keys or worked solutions, making them essentially useless. Even worse, Fernandes often promises worked-out solutions, but rarely delivers. When he did deliver, he had done only a few problems in the margins the night before the exam, some with glaring errors. Worked-out solutions are never given for the homework problems after they have been graded, so if you make a mistake, you're left to figure out how to solve it correctly on your own.

Although theory is taught, how to approach and complete problems similar to the ones on the homework, quizzes, and exams is not covered enough.

The saving grace of this class is that the exams are pretty easy and there are a ton of curves. If you're able to self-learn concepts well enough so that you can do any of the homework, quizzes, or practice problems, you'll end up with a 90+ on all midterms and the final. All homework and quizzes above a 92 were rounded to a 100, and the lowest midterm was replaced by the final if you did better on the final. The overall grade or final was also likely curved.",2
"A pretty easy but somewhat challenging (in the sense that there is a lot of material) class. A lot of topics are covered (such as different distributions, estimators, probability, etc.) so just make sure you stay on top of the material. My only complaint is that I had 8 am discussion which was quite challenging to go to once a week especially since I am a commuter. I ended up missing almost half of the discussions, which sucked since there was a quiz every discussion. He records all lectures so I just watched those instead of attending lecture. He replaces your lowest exam grade with the grade you get on your final, and also curves the regular exams by 5 points and the final by 10 points (perhaps even more in certain semesters if the class is struggling). The HW were a bit time consuming but the TAs usually go over most of the answers during discussion. Without the TA's help it would usually take me 2-3 hours to finish otherwise. 

My only regret is the fact that I did pretty bad on two of the exams because I started studying too late. If I were to take this class again, I would start to review the material a few days prior to the exam rather than the day of. The final wasn't as bad as I thought (I got a 75% on it), just make sure you really understand estimators as most of the exam was based on that.",4
"If you do the work, you should be able to get an A. I initially struggled, but once I found the rhythm of the course, it became much easier. 

He provides sample questions for the exams - which are based of homework and the examples he covers in class. While he will not provide a solution manual for these problems, if you keep up with the work, it is not hard to find the answers in his notes. Also his exams are not the practice exam with numbers changed, so be careful about that. He expects you to work through all of the content covered in lectures! 

I did not find the final exam particularly hard, as most of it was based off what was done in lectures and discussion ... but this could just be me. I did study a lot for it though. 

All in all,  I found this to be a useful class, and if you have the chance you should take it with Fernandes. You might have to work some, but you will learn a lot!",4
"The class was taught at a pretty high level, he went through a ton of content ... if he were to do this again, perhaps he could skip the first couple weeks, and use that time to tie in concepts at the end ... the content on estimators was interesting, but there was not much time. Maybe a week lost in snow days might have affect his course plan. 

Anyway, good class. Also, don't trust his grade distribution for Stat410 here ... it is definitely not an easy A.",4
"Dropped out of high school calculus because I was failing, and was really nervous when I found out I had to take calc again in college. Really glad I did my research and was taught calc 1 by Professor Hernandes. I was going in with goals to get at least a B on every exam, and he made that goal very easy to achieve. Throughout the course there is a lot of web assign homework, two discussion worksheets a week, and five total exams. He relies heavily on the textbook for material, so as long as you memorize equations, understand steps to solve problems, and overall understand how to do the math you should be fine. Whether you are learning calculus from scratch or have taken it before, I recommend him. The problems he goes over in class come straight from the textbooks, as well as discussion questions. He uses scribble as a tool for students to access in class notes, and they are very well organized. He also records every lecture so you can go back and rewatch if you don't understand, or just watch if you miss class. I strongly recommend going to class though, I sat front row, asked questions and never missed a class and pulled out a good grade. His exams are also really fair, and they are non calculator so it's all math you can do in your head and he doesn't really require you to simplify your answer. He grades the exam based on the fact that you know the steps to solve, not just if you got the answer right or wrong. He grades by partial credit. There are a total of five exams, that can seem scary. But as long as you are able to devote time to studying (trust me you have plenty of time, I took six classes and worked 4 days a week, there is time), you should be fine. Even make a study group with kids in your class or discussion, that helped me a lot with understanding how to do things I didn't understand. Always ask questions in discussion if you're confused, TA is there to help. The exams are really fair too. They are just like the problems done in class and in discussion. Practice those and the practice exams and you should be fine. 
Professor Hernandes is also very motivational, he knows calc isn't easy and shows that he does really want you to succeed.
I would say the only flaw with him is that you have to sometimes fill-in the blank with what equations he used (""common sense"" equations not taught in the textbook) when solving. Sometimes feels like a mad-lib, but once you know what he did, it helps you understand the math better and keeps it locked in your memory. 
If you have to take a high calc course after, his teaching style and curriculum is very good for building a strong calc foundation.
Anyways, 100% recommend would take him again.",4
"I really enjoyed this class! The coursework wasn't necessarily conceptually challenging, but there is a volume of it, as other reviews mention. Personally, I felt like Fernandes provided a lot of resources, such as posting notes, lectures, the textbook (which was provided, though rough) and his video lectures from 2020. Besides this, him and my TA were extremely accessible via office hours and email.

Before taking this class, a lot of reviews mention that he has a lot of R projects. The past semester, there was only one project, and I spoke with him about how it was pretty difficult as a non-coding intensive major. He understands, and he mentioned he's looking into other methods of visualizing the concepts so if the R projects are a concern, there's that.

In terms of other classwork, sometimes the homework feels a bit longer than necessary/tedious, specifically when it comes to listing out outcomes. Other than that, they felt pretty fair. Quizzes mirrored the main concepts in lecture, so as long as I paid attention, I did well. I also felt the exams were fair as well, never felt like there were any insane curveballs. Class averages were consistently high (90's range). My grade can only be attributed to my personal choices, and I definitely recommend him if you want a professor who cares about you succeeding.",4
"Preface to say I did take Calc AB and BC in highschool but I got a D and F respectively. Went to class twice in the beginning of the year before I realized it was a waste of time and stopped going. He knows his stuff but isn't so good at teaching it (also a bit sassy/he has edge). Just go to GSS, math success, keystone tutoring, office hours, alla that. When you don't understand something, double down on it because you WILL get it on the exam. Skip webassign questions that seem impossible unless you just do it for the game. If you are normal they will just make you go crazy and lose it. Pick your TA wisely, shop around in the begining of the year don't be lazy. If your TA sucks at explaining you will eat the consequences as Fernandes can be hands off at times. I will give him benefit of the doubt as this is his first semester teaching MATH140, but there were multiple times where he posted canvas updates at 2 or 3am, or for an assignment due at 12:00am, he would make an announcement post at 12:01am that it got extended another day. Like one minute after it was due.
Make friends who go to class so they can keep you in the know or there will be a plethora of stuff he says but doesn't post and you will find out about it the hard way. At one point I stopped going to discussion too and just went to GSS and still ended up with like an 100%+ exam avg. He gave extra credit up to 105/100 on select exams. Change your mindset about math you are capable and it is more than doable. I don't know about other lecturers for MATH140 but if you did the work you got the grade. Don't let it be a skill issue.",2
Such a nice and understanding professor ever!!,4
"Fernandes # 1. The greatest, one of the best. Willing to hear criticism from students and correct things.",4
"This class thus far has been a complete and total disaster. The averages of our first quiz were around 40%, our next quiz had an average of 30%. I understand that Professor Fernandes is teaching this course for the first time and developing content on his own but it really feels like no attempt is being made to translate the knowledge to us.

He whizzes through complex derivations and algebraic manipulation at light speed to the point where nobody understands anything. As a Stats minor who has taken 2 classes previously in this department and confidently received As in both, this class has been nothing short of a catastrophe. When speaking to my other friends in this class who are also Stat minors or double majors, we all feel equally confused and appalled by the way this class is being led.

My friends who previously took this professor have nothing but good things to say but I truly have nothing but complaints. He is unable to see that the entire class is severely struggling and I can see that many of my peers have opted out of coming to class altogether.

If he would simply slow down, clearly define every subject and then actually explain each concept in a way that is understandable, we would be far better off. I miss the teaching styles of my previous professors sorely, who would break down and explain a concept before jumping into practice problems. Then when we would have quizzes, homeworks, or exams, the problems would be closely related to the examples we'd worked out in class.

This professor gets stuck in the weeds of theory and calculation to the point where he spends nearly the entire period working out complex algebraic manipulations that are so confusing and ill-explained that nobody learns anything. The homework is then an exercise of torture that feels far too complex and entirely unrelated to the concepts we are covering in class with the quizzes being a deeper decent into the hell of STAT426 where, truly, every quiz has left myself and my friends in a deeper confusion of how we are expected to perform in this class.

I should have dropped this class while I could. I recommend that you avoid this class at all costs. As a 4.0 student, I am truly fearing for my sanity and my GPA. Jonathan Fernandes, PLEASE reconsider how you lead this course. Slow down, focus on practical examples, have the homework DIRECTLY follow from those practical examples, have the quizzes DIRECTLY follow from class examples and homework and have some mercy on us poor students.",0
"I would have to mostly agree with the previous review for this class with him, its basically really unorganized and he doesn't explain the content very well. I want to emphasize that I think he's a very very nice person and clearly wants students to do well, but the course is so poorly structured and the way things are being explained so confusing that our highest quiz avg is like a 60% across the first 3 quizzes. There's a pretty high tendency that whatever was on the homework won't be on the quiz, it feels, and instead it will be something random from the content covered in class more recently so its a little hard to prep. I think the thing that actually makes it confusing is he doesn't really break down and explain concepts so much as mention them and do an example, but the example will be really specific and not that educational. Or, like the other review says, he will spend a long time doing algebraic manipulations and calculations that are largely unexplained. I got an A+ in Stat410 before this and there's a lot of stuff where it feels like it just pops out of nowhere, so I'm not sure if its a difference in professor expectations regarding 400/410 or what but I certainly feel like some things are out of thin air. He also gives a lot of stuff in very specific forms it feels and expects us to generalize it ourselves, which feels maybe the opposite of how I would expect most classes to go pedagogically. I don't know a single person currently doing ""well"" in the class.",1
"It is a difficult class ... and it is taking me sometime to get used to working out the details. 

Homework's require you to do work - but they push you to work on some additional details. 

There are in-class quizzes, that he he mostly pulls out from the calculations covered in lectures. It is true that this is his first time teaching the class, and he did offer to teach us using the slides (how this class was previously taught), and the whole class unanimously said no to, including myself.  

I get it that the course might not vibe with everyone - but you can always talk to him, he's extremely approachable.",4
"Stopped going to lectures because he literally just writes off the textbook and explains it in a way that leaves you more confused most of the time. Seems like a great guy but he does not prepare you well at all. Basically you can take him and self study the class and go to discussions, you probably will still do well. Just don't expect to learn from lectures.",0
"Danul is a great person, but as a lecturer isn't very engaging. Most of the semester I have spent learning the course material on my own because I don't get too much out of his lectures. If you have questions for him he is always good with answering them.",1
His lectures are pretty hard to follow but some are okay. You honestly can just use Kahn Academy to teach yourself better,1
"This dude has absolutely no personality, he may even be a robot. He knows what he's talking about and isn't the worst lecturer. His exams are extremely difficult and the homeworks are even harder. But if I didn't make it clear enough in the beginning, the man is a robot.",1
"Not the worst professors at UMD. He gets a lot of flak because so many students have an ego thinking know everything about calc since they did it in high school. His lectures are heavy from the textbook, so read the section before class and the lecture becomes a review session to solidify the material. Come to class wanting to learn and visit office hours with questions, and you will get an A. ",2
Bad lecturer with poor explanation skills.  He only copies definitions from the textbook,0
"Absolutely terrible professor that should be avoided at all costs. Gives poor explanations and basically just reads the textbook in class and provides no examples. Exams are graded harshly and some exams contain trick questions that the Ta's cant even answer.
Bad move hombre.",0
"I took MATH240 with Danul in Fall 2019. His lectures are incredibly dry; he basically just reads off the textbook while writing the definition word-for-word extremely slowly. Having a good TA can really help you actually learn and master the material. 

I stopped going to lectures halfway through the semester and it didn't affect my grade at all. The textbook is very helpful, practice problems from the book regularly and you'll be set. The exams are almost exactly like the practice exams.",1
"Not that bad, not that great. Helps to go to class/watch corona-era videos because he covers what'll be on exams. Get help from TA and you'll be fine",2
"This guy kinda just reads from the textbook, but if you come to him about specific questions he is quite helpful.",2
"has pre lecture videos which are very helpful as his lectures will be review of major concepts/ more in depth with examples, always open to questions, good/helpful TAs. textbook is extremely helpful when studying for exams and doing homework. people say he is not that great of a teacher, but i found no problem with him ",3
use the textbook and you will do well. he is not as bad as everyone says he is.,3
"I took this course in Fall 2019

Pros:
+ Okay at explaining concepts.
+ He teaches based on the textbook, so it's a good resource to learn from.
+ Quizzes are open note and you can ask him for help, so they're not too bad.
+ Tests are fair.

Cons:
- Could be better at lecturing
- Homeworks can often feel very and unnecessarily hard compared to assessments, which can be frustrating. They can take a long time to finish.",3
"He's not as bad as people make it seem. Maybe not the greatest choice for a lower level math class with a rigid curriculum, but if you take him for 310, he's fine. Also, his exams are more than fair and he curves the class.",3
Don't take any class with this man. Bad lecturer with poor explanations. Exams do not reflect textbook explanations as he says what so ever and his study guides are completely garbage. ,0
"After the first week I stopped going to lecture. If not for my TA and Khan Academy I would not have made it through a class that isn't that hard. Find another teacher. He has terrible hand writing, hard to understand and not a fun person. Most people I know have said the same thing. Avoid Danul at all costs.",0
"First off, he's an average lecturer in my opinion, though he makes an effort to clear up misconceptions and overall seems very approachable. With that said, I ended up missing the final and he was nice enough to let me take a make-up exam the next day, which he really had no obligation to do. As such, I'd say he's overall a decent professor but he does care to help you through course-related troubles you experience.",3
"One of the best instructors I've had in MATH/STAT at UMD. He was very nice and gave fair homeworks and exams. A lot of the homework he and the TA go over to help you on them, and they prepare you well for exam questions. He could be more clear in his study guides for exams but I think this is fine because the exams aren't that tough if you do the homeworks. Some of the harder concepts he explains in what seems at first a rather obtuse way, but once you get through it and do examples it gets easier to understand. HE also takes a lot of questions in the middle of lecture (sometimes too many dare I say). ",3
"I had Danul for both MATH240 and STAT400. He does a much better job teaching STAT400 than MATH240. Overall I would say his lectures are average they can sometimes be confusing and he can skip over material. The books however for MATH240 and STAT400 are phenomenal also Danul does make an effort to clear up any misconceptions and help students if needed. The saving grace for this class is that the practice exams are usually extremely similar to the actual exam. My recommendation for both classes is read the book, do the homework/practice exams and you can easily pull at least a B.",2
"He is not a very good teacher, his teaching style is confusing, takes too long to get to the point, and has difficulty answering questions. He's a nice guy and is flexible with due dates, deadlines, and so on. But the only reason I'm doing well in this class is because I've taken Calc 1 in high school. I find the best strategy for keeping up with the pace is to watch his recorded lectures on mute on double speed, much better than attending lecture in person. Look elsewhere if you're taking 140 and you haven't taken Calc 1 in high school.",1
"He's not a great lecturer -- pretty ramble-y and doesn't do a great job explaining stuff. Probably wouldn't be doing that well if I hadn't already taken calculus in high school -- definitely would look for someone else if you're a first time calculus student. However, I have no complaints about him as a person. He offers extensions on homework if enough people ask and seems to be a pretty understanding guy. If you get him as a professor it's not the end of the world -- some of these reviews are way too negative in my opinion. ",2
"Will just read the textbook to you, but he is good with questions. The TAs, GSS, khan academy, and tutors are going to be far more helpful.",1
"I thought Danul was a fine professor. The lectures can tend to drag on a bit, but he does a good job with making sure people understand the material well. He is good about responding to emails, and he takes pauses in class to ask for questions. One thing I will say is that the homeworks are pretty tough, but the exams do not reflect the difficulty of the homeworks. Not a bad choice for STAt410. Just be prepared to spend about 3 hrs/week on this class. ",2
"STAT400 with Danul is easy enough (hence my expectation of an A- and my two stars), however his teaching style is truly the opposite of helpful. His lectures are delivered at a glacial pace and end up going in circles on some occasions. The textbook questions assigned are barely representative of the questions that are on the exams. My only saving grace in this class was my TA absolutely carrying me and the fact that the exams have a reasonable difficulty level.

TLDR: If you can help it, do not take STAT400 with Danul. However, if you must, be prepared for self-studying.",1
I dont quite get why people trash on this professor. Danul is pretty good at teaching STAT400 and his tests are VERY VERY similar if not identical to his practice exams he gives you two weeks before the test. Textbook questions that are assigned are much harder than what he actually gives on the tests and are a free 40% of your grade. Would recommend this guy for any stat classes you take. He is the posterboy of achieving an A in a class. ,4
"I personally thought that Danul was a decent professor. The homework assignments were a decent amount of work, and they weren't too challenging. The TAs go over the homework questions during discussion, so I recommend going to them if you're struggling with it. 

His exam questions were a bit different from the examples done in class but his study guides are exactly the same as the actual exam (just with different values). So if you know how to solve the problems that are on the study guide, you will get a good grade on the exams (final as well). He might change that up next time but at least that's how it was for me in Spring 2022.",3
"Danul is a decent professor for STAT400. His lectures can be a bit confusing but as long as you attend his office hours and discussions, you'll be fine. He explains the concepts well if you ask him for help outside class. His homework assignments can be a bit lengthy but it's important because it helps you understand the materials. Danul gives fair exams that are similar to the study guides. Overall, if you understand the homework problems and study guides, the exams shouldn't be hard. Danul is a good choice for STAT400.",3
"Genuinely, I would give Prof. Gunatilleka 4 stars but I want to raise his reviews a little bit. He is generous and nice, the sample exams are always helpful. Besides, the exams have average around 80~90, which is decent. The HW is tough but you can always get full scores. I would recommend you guys to take his class.
Disadvantages: Not well-organized, you neither know where his examples are from nor which page he is talking about. ",4
"One of the best professors in STAT. He's exams are very good (nothing difficult), but you need to study hard.",4
"Professor Gunatilleka was a fairly good lecturer and communicator. His teaching is nothing groundbreaking, and you'll definitely need to focus during discussion sections in order to keep up, but you can definitely do worse in terms of low-level math profs. Plus, he was willing to push back deadlines if he didn't finish covering material in lecture.",2
Math120 was only manageable because i took ap calc in high school. he talks a ton and make you write a lot. I had to learn most of the new materials myself because his lectures are not relevant. if you didn’t take ap calc or have prior knowledge you’d probably fail his class as he cannot teach,1
"Haven't yet completed this course, but I can tell you this is the best stat professor in UMD. I took him for stat400 and now stat401 and the format for the class is set up for everyone to get an easy A or A+ in the class. He makes concepts easy to understand and all the averages for his midterms have been 90+. Everyone who is trashing this professor is in the lower level maths and complain. Take this professor for all your stat courses and you will get a free A.",4
"Pretty good STAT professor in UMD. His homework is not too challenging, he is very lenient in grading, and he tries to make lectures enjoyable.",4
"Dont seem to get why this professor is getting so much hate, probably because he is a stat professor and teaching calculus. He is a great stat professor, so I can 100% recommend him for taking your stats classes, not so much calculus I guess. His exams are fairly identical to the practice exams, homework is easy, and fairly understandable lecturer. Great!",4
"Great professor. Content is easy to understand from each lecture, homework are 5-6 questions each week, and midterms are easy. Would recommend this professor for stat courses.",4
"Great professor, his lectures were great and quizzes/exams were straightforward. If you put in the work, you will get the grade you want.",4
"Very accommodating professor. I got some points off on my quizzes and explained my logic further and he gave the points back. Very lenient and understanding professor who truly wants you to succeed. Quizzes are free points, homework is bearable, and practice tests are literally identical to the real exams, hence why most of our exam scores were average around 91+",4
"quizzes are easy, midterms are same as the review he puts out, homework is fine, but most boring lectures ever.",3
"He's great at answering questions you may have, but in terms of lecture material, he's not so good. I had to learn almost everything from the textbook. On top of that, he writes a lot of things down, and does not go through a lot of examples of the problems that are related to the material covered in lecture. Also, with homework on MingPress, it can take a long time and sometimes there are glitches that mark your answer as wrong even though you got it correct.",1
"Very clear at explaining statistics concepts, quizzes and exams are pretty easy. Only downsides are that his lectures can be quite dry and coding projects are somewhat annoying to do.",3
"He has an amazing grasp of the content and his lectures were great in my opinion. He is usually very good at answering questions as his understanding and teaching ability are up there with the best I have had here at UMD. Homework is meant to challenge you, but the grading is very generous if you give a good attempt. Exams are much easier and are more closely alike to the more simple examples gone over in class.
Looking at the other reviews, definitely expect to spend some time on homework as you usually need a deep understanding to get to the solution, but he often helps. He gives extensions if you ask or enough people ask. Another review said he does not tell you where you are in the book, that may have been true in the past, but this semester he always told us where we were, and if you just ask what example it is he tells you. I assume he doesn't write it on the board every time because chances are most people wouldn't need to know it.
Also, I want to give credit to him for being mature about distractions in our class as it was often interrupted.",4
"Truly a 4 star professor but his reviews are a bit crazy, so I want to raise his rating a bit higher. Like others have said, do the homework, review the practice exams, and you should be fine with this class. Coding projects are a bit annoying but they are not hard. Would recommend.",4
"Great professor, exams are identical to practice",4
Lectures are a bit iffy but he will always be there to help in office hours. TA's were great,4
"Exams were literally the same as the practice exams, I think he was just lazy and did not care. Lectures were okay, you can tell he has a passion for statistics but still were a bit boring. Homework is very easy. Would recommend.",4
"Great professor, would recommend for anyone taking statistics, this is my third time taking a class with him and still getting an A",4
"Finished all of his classes with A+, stat400, stat401, stat410, you may think I am a genius, but that is not the case, his class is designed for students to get an A. The homeworks are straight from the textbook which are easy, exams are LITERALLY the same as the practice, LITERALLY. He does not throw any curveballs in the class and genuinely loves teaching statistics. Sure he may not be a good calculus professor as previous reviews say, but all his statistics ratings are HIGH, he is truly the most fair and generous professor in the statistics department.",4
"Best professor for statistics, makes things so easy to understand",4
"Weekly quizzes to boost your grade, homeworks are easy, practice exams are identical to the exams, don't know what more you need to get a free a+",4
"Lectures were boring but TA's helped with it, made sure his students understood the material",4
"The tests were crazy the averages were 90+ and this class was very bearable with him, would recommend.",4
"I was honestly really scared to take STAT410 because of how hard I heard it was compared to STAT400, but Danul (his first name) truly made this an enjoyable experience. First of all, the man actually cares and tries his best while lecturing and you can clearly see that. He really does try to put an emphasis on teaching people to understand the broad underlying themes and concepts of statistics rather than being pedantic on the small technical details which I really appreciate. This is the first time I've taken a statistics course and not felt like it was just another chug and plug math course- I felt myself able to apply the concepts I learnt. The HWs are a little tough, but this is no problem because you can go to his OH and he will help you through it all (I was able to get 100% for most of the HWs this way). Some HW questions are graded only for completion which really helps. Quizzes are pretty simple just review each weeks notes and you'll be fine. The exams are extremely fair and are VERY similar to the practice exams he gives. 

To top it off, he is very accommodating in general. Whenever the class had a major doubt about one of the HW questions he addressed the problem directly and just gave us an extension. He dropped the number of HWs near finals weeks cuz he knew we were already very busy. Overall, this class does take effort, but it is certainly doable when you take it with this GOAT",4
Great professor,4
Pretty fair professor for stat,4
Easy professor exams are very similar to practice,4
Easiest stat class of my life with this profesor,4
"Great professor, TA's were nice",4
"Pretty good professor, the grade I got in the end was my fault, but if you do the work you will get the grade you want",4
"Danul is a very nice guy. He really cares about the success of his students. The lectures are fine. He is a generous grader on homeworks, quizzes, and exams. His exams are very similar to the practice problems. He will let you make up missed quizzes and gives homework extension if you ask him. He will also release solutions to practice exam problems (which are very similar to the actual exams)- just ask him! The exam average is very high. If you put the required effort, you can really get an A+ in his class. I had a really busy semester, so I could not put more time in this class and still ended up with a B. 
Take his section for Stat410 if you really want a good grade. Unlike other sections, there are no R projects in his class :)",4
Great stat professor,4
"Like all the other reviews said, professor is very fair, exams are easy, homework is not too bad, R projects are the only pain tho",4
"Great professor, easy ass exams that are identical to review",4
"Not sure why his reviews are this low. This guy is a very nice professor and clearly cares about his students. His homework is literally just like 5-6 problems each week and they can be found online. Furthermore, his tests are very similar to the practice exam, meaning he changes a few numbers and calls it a day. Would recommend.",4
Very passionate professor and easy,4
Danul is a beast,4
"Great professor, communicative via emails, and exams are so easy.",4
"This man is a GOAT. 
G - GREATEST AT LECTURING
O - OVERALL EXAM GRADES WERE 90+ EACH ONE
A -  ALL HOMEWORK IS SEARCHABLE ONLINE AND EXAMS ARE THE SAME AS PRACTICE
T -  TEACHES LIKE HE ACTUALLY CARES",4
"Pretty decent professor. TA's mostly helped me, but exams were very fair and I can tell this isnt his best subject to teach, but he tries his best",4
"Nice guy, but I learned more from the textbook than him.",1
"This class turned to be a self teaching class. He is not good at lecturing. His exams are completely opposite of his teaching materials. Moreover, his exam is nothing similar to practice exam.",0
"Great professor. Lectures are easy to understand, the tests are exactly the same as the practice exam, last review guy must be dumb. Professor is great take him!",4
Easy exams hw and projects,4
"Extremely good professor. Had him for MATH140 and now w/ STAT400. Exams are identical to practice exams (literally), HW is very fair. Very responsive with emails, and answers students' questions extremely detailed. 20/10 professor.

Don't even know what the person's review 3 reviews down is on about, probably didn't even attended class and expected to be handed a free A!",4
"Easy professor, like everyone said, tests are identical to practice",4
"Great professor, homework can be found online and the proefssor has easy exams",4
Love him,4
Class is very easy and understandable. People be putting bad rep on danul but hes honestly a goat professor. Lectures can be quite boring because this class is EASY but his exams are exactly the same as practice.,4
"He is not a good lecturer. Moreover, he explained easy concepts in a difficult way.",0
"free a, just do practice exam and u straight",4
exams are pretty much the practice exams he hands out. But otherwise not the greatest at explaining things.,3
"awesome prof and super fair class, TAKE HIM",4
"I truly felt that some students just overpraised the professor. He is not a good lecturer. If you would like to learn the material find another professor, he taught the material in a confused manner. His practice exam is not enough to do well in the exam. For example, his final exam contain only few questions to prepare for the exam.",0
Really really straightforward and easy to get an A he explains stuff ok,4
"TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This dude literally gives out free A's. All I needed were a 50% or higher on all the exams. The exams were exactly like the practice exams so make sure you copy down the practice exams onto your cheat sheet as detailed as possible. His homeworks and projects were free 100s. They go over the homeworks in discussion but the answers are online. The project can seem difficult so use ChatGPT or go to the math tutoring at Kirwan.
Danul is a really nice guy. He talks slow so that everyone can understand and sometimes even cracks jokes.. You can pass this class with bare minimum understanding. If you really want to understand the content then just pay attention in class, participate and read the textbook. It's up to you how deeply you want to understand the content. The TAs were helpful. He responds to emails in a timely manner and is willing to answer questions.",4
I attended 4 classes the whole year and ended with an A. The first class I went to was the introduction class (first day). The second time I showed up was for the first midterm. The third time I showed up was for the second midterm. The fourth I showed up was for the final. Homeworks are R projects are a free 50% of your grade. The midterms are the exact same as the practice exam he gives the week before. 1 sheet of notes is allowed for the exams and 2 sheets for the final. I copied down the answers and formulas from the practice exams and went in and took the real exams and got an A on both. Too easy and the professor himself is VERY NICE and understanding. He is very passionate about stats and genuinely cares for his students.,4
Danul is a straightforward professor and STAT400 class is fairly easy to do well in if you prepare properly. The textbook is really good for practice problems and he is all around very fair when it comes to assignment grading. He should be the go-to pick for this class.,3
"Great professor overall. Lecture's are very informative and very helpful in office hours. Practice exams are similar to the real exams, grading is pretty lenient too. Highly recommend!",4
"I love ""Mesty Besty"" as his teachings made sense, exams were very lenient as you were allowed your own formula sheet, and the TAs were generous with partial credit as long as you showed substantial work for your answer. STATs used to be one of my weakest subjects, but taking it with Mestiyage proved that under proper guidance you can succeed in anything. Thank you Mestiyage!",4
"Easy class with this professor where his exams are basically the same as the practice exams. 

He explains things very badly in a very dry, theoretical, unnecessary complicated manner. 

He records his lectures and uploads the sheet he writes on during lecture so that you do not have to attend in person.
However, I must confess that I never went to lecture, never watched the recordings, nor read the sheets he would upload. 

He had amazing TAs who taught much better than him and held great review sessions right before the exam.

Responds fast to email.

Homework was free points, and the TAs would just give you the answers during discussion.

Practice exams were often riddled with typos. With the mathematical notation, you would often be scratching your head thinking whether the question is asking for something you've never heard before, before realizing that it's just a mistake. 

R projects were annoying and painful but just going to the R tutor to sort them out was good enough. He cared about his students, and was willing to grant extensions without too much of an issue. 

Overall, this professor did not make things unnecessarily hard. The fact that I did not get an A is solely my fault. I feel with a bit more effort I could have gotten an A.",2
He made everything super straightforward. No surprises on exams. He also recorded every lecture. Very nice and explained things well.,0
"Danul is a straightforward and caring professor. STAT400 is fairly easy as long as you review notes and do the practice exams (and read the textbook if you want to understand topics better).
Pros:
- Good notes: great handwriting. He posted his notes on the weekend.
- Exams: as long as you did the practice exams and understood it well enough, you passed his midterms and final.
- Fair grading: show you work. Even if your answer or calculation is wrong, as long as you show your thought process, he gave a lot of partial credits.
- Homework: The TAs went over the solutions in the discussion on Friday, so Danul is giving you free grades because the homework is usually due on Monday. 
Cons:
- A bit confusing. There were quite a lot of contents to cover in 75 minutes. Read the textbook or google for clarification.",4
"Straightforward and easy to understand. I stopped going to the in person lectures after the first two classes because he uploads all the lectures online and commute times. As long as you watch the lectures and pay attention, you'll do fine. Would definitely recommend.",4
Fine professor. You could honestly skip every class and learn from the textbook and it would make no difference. I never went and just copied his notes and was fine. MingPress is annoying especially if you don't know the format of the answer so good luck with that.,2
"Exams in the class are super fair, as they are near identical to the practice exams, and some of the assigned homework questions.
Danul speaks fairly slowly in the lecture, which does give you plenty of time to record/process what he says, but also can get painfully annoying sometimes.
He also tends to make a fair number of mistakes in his lectures/notes, which can be slightly frustrating to deal with at times.
He could also do a better job of explaining concepts and providing necessary formulas, as he spends a lot of time giving derivations, and also spends a lot of time explaining concepts through examples/scenarios that aren't that helpful. 
Danul also is a caring professor who is responsive to emails and gives many chances to ask questions.

Overall, he is a decent professor, and is a decent option for STAT400.",3
"Danul is a great professor. He lectures well, and if you don't understand the concept, I would either ask him right away in class as he gives detailed explanations and will restate things without hesitation, or I would go to his office hours where he is also very helpful. I went into this class only after taking AP Stats in high school, and if you're like me I forgot pretty much everything after walking out of the exam room. I would say that if you're very new to stats, the course will prove to be a little difficult and first and you might not understand what's happening, but keep on solving problems, asking questions, and eventually you'll get an intuitive grasp. 
The homeworks are pretty difficult, and if worst comes to worst there are answers online that you can use as reference. For answers that are already written in the back of the textbook, I'm pretty sure Danul is okay with you looking at them, because one day I walked into office hours to ask a question and he said ""did you refer to the answer key before coming?"" which was kind of funny. He's also a really chill guy and makes occasional jokes that keep the lectures interesting. I remember one time during the finals review lecture, he said ""and I'll be grading harshly for the final,"" and the class fell dead silent. He broke the silence soon saying that exams must have had us pretty stressed out, because obviously that was a joke. So it goes without saying that him and his grader grades homeworks, quizzes, and exams very leniently, and as long as you somewhat get the concept and the calculation, he'll give many many partial credits. There was also a decent curve at the end of the semester. 
His practice exam ""study guides"" are very similar to the actual exam, and the final also contains problems of the same caliber. If you can do the homework confidently, undoubtedly you will ace the exams. Even if you find them a little difficult, a bit of studying goes a really long way.
The last thing I'm gonna say, is make sure to attend lectures. I don't know about STAT400, but he doesn't record any, and does most of his stuff on the chalkboard. He's a good lecturer, so it's worthwhile going to.",4
Great professor,4
"Great professor, tests are so easy",4
"Exams are identical to the practice exam, like I literally mean it, they are just number swapped because he probably does not care about this class. Homework can be found exactly on chegg and the quizzes are literally super easy so long as you pay attention in class. R Projects are the only hard part about this class but then again if you do well on the exams, you will be safe for an A",4
Exams are identical to practice exam. You get a formula sheet. Homeworks are easy. This is literally STAT400 that he teaches but a little more deeper in knowledge. The first half of the course is just STAT400 review if you took it with him. Easy peasy.,4
"If you show up to class (or at least watch the lecture videos b/c he doesn't take attendance) then you'll be fine. Discussions are also important bc there was quizzes, but the TA explains everything right before them",4
"He is a little boring at times but lectures are recorded. He acknowledges that most people taking this class are CS majors and tailors content to be relevant for them. My TA was fantastic and he was accommodating when ELMS kept deleting my homework. Exams are exactly like the study guide.
The only annoying thing is the R projects because R was never brought up in lecture(there was a pdf on ELMS).",3
"He is a fair teacher and grader, the way the course is structured makes sense. He clearly cares about students and wants them to succeed. Only complaint is that the class is too much structured for CS majors and it makes it hard for people who must take it for other reasons to follow along, as he assumes you already understand concepts and notation that are used in CS. Over all though, he is a good professor.",3
"Danul sometimes goes over things too deeply or spends too long on one problem, but overall he's a good teacher. Answers questions effectively and cares about his students. There are homeworks (which can sometimes be very long), R Projects (also kinda take a while), two midterms (very fair exams, decent practice material), and a final (which was quite difficult and riddled with typos, causing him to call them out during the exam and having students redo the problem). But overall, not a bad prof. Take him.",3
"Literally my favorite professor at this school and I've taken two different classes with him. He's so smart and you can genuinely tell he cares and puts a lot of time into the course, but at the same time he's so accommodating of students. He literally could not be nicer. He also teaches super well and is happy to clarify any concepts!",4
"Lectures are recorded and the notes are posted. The exams are fairly simply and the partial credit is very good. The only annoying part of this class was the R projects, so don't do the entire thing the night it's due.",4
"DANUL IS THE MOST UNDERRATED PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! If your put in effort, even if you are checked out for weeks, if you put in the effort you will get a good grade. He is intentional in helping students earn good grades and does everything possible to do that. He is also very well spoken, its not common to have a professor who communicates the instruction effectively while helping students get the grade they want. Must take him, you will never regret not taking him.",4
Super great! He is a great lecturer and records his lectures. His exams are similar to his practice as well.,4
very good statistics professor that knows what he's talking about and is passionate about statistics. he makes the class very manageable as well. There are weekly quizzes which are very easy. the exams are pretty fair and the final as well. just review his previous exams and final and you'll be fine. he also allows you to bring note sheets. the only reason I ended up with a B+ is because I started skipping class a lot. if you go to class it should be an easy A.,4
"Nice! Easy class, didn't turn in an R project and still got an A-.",4
"Exams were very easy, no quizzes. Only thing that took time was the R Projects which were reproachable. However the grading for R Projects was very lax. STAT400 has the mot applicable stuff from math so far and the professor teaches it at the most surface level possible. The professor cared about the students but I don't think he cared about us actually learning the material which is understandable since this class is just treated like a roadblock on the way to getting a CS Degree by most people taking it.

I recommend taking it for an easy credit but I would personally take STAT410 if I actually wanted to learn stat and prob. theory a little in depth.",3
He explains the fundamental of a topic but then rushes through everything else when you need to know that stuff. He also speaks really slow so the class is boring to sit through. He's nice but if you need topics thoroughly explained to you I don't recommend.,2
Great Prof. Exams are pretty easy if you can do the study guide (80% identical with different numbers). The other 20% is usually from lecture examples. Homeworks are pretty time consuming but doable and same with the projects (the last one). Who you have as your TA is also very important because for this semester one out the three TA's graded the hw's and project very harshly. If your TA's initials are SS. TRY TO SWITCH TO A DIFF SECTION. But other than that pretty chill and easy class.,4
"Amazing professor. He writes everything out as hes explaining things in lecture, and he is very clear. His handwriting is a bit messy, but its legible!! His homework assignments are very easy, as long as you paid attention in class. If you're having a hard time with them, he provides the textbook in the homework program so you can open it and complete the problem with the textbook. The homework assignments are excellent practice for his exams! There is a quiz in every discussion, but the TA goes over the lecture material before the quiz and its very easy. Exams may seem intimidating, but he sends out a practice exam and reviews the class before the exam. 

He is an amazing teacher and provides a lot of valuable resources, take him!! I've taken calculus before and I thought it was super hard, he made it easy!",4
Very disorganized.  Practice exam answers are never simplified and the answers are very hard to understand.  Did not post homework on elms so it was hard to stay organized.  Does not explain things well and is not very approachable with questions.,1
"If you have to take Math120, take Danul! He is a professor who actually cares about his students. He takes the time to thoroughly go through problems and answer any questions. His exams are very fair and very similar to the practice exams he gives you. Homework was straightforward and quizzes were super easy due to the amazing TAs! Take him!",4
"Danul is a wonderful lecturer and probably the best professor I've had within the MATH/STAT departments. His notes are very sufficient. Even for lectures I missed, I looked at his notes without looking at any external material and did well on the exams. His exams are also very fair and he gives you a detailed guide with practice exam questions which he abides by when making the exam. His pace can be slow at times, but it's better than being too fast. If you go to lectures, you'll do great but many people skipped but still did okay, that's not on him though. 100% recommend!",4
"TLDR: Hit or miss, depends on your learning style

Personally, I thought that his lectures weren't helpful because he always explains things in hella convoluted and wordy way. Instead of a slideshow, he writes everything out in sentences on sheets of paper. He also assigns 3 R projects throughout the semester which as far as I'm aware, no other STAT400 professor does. He never teaches R either; he gives us an R guide which isn't exactly helpful so you end up having to search online for R help. I never learned anything in class so I ended up skipping and learning from the textbook and STAT400 notes from past professors.

He does record and post lecture videos which is nice if you miss/skip lecture or he went too fast in class. Discussion is just going over some of the upcoming homework questions so it's pretty skippable.",2
"Lectures are not mandatory and class notes are uploaded online. Having a good TA helps alot, my TA was super helpful and went over material over lecture in discussion very thoroughly. Weekly quizzes and hw, workload is not too heavy",4
"Overall not bad, I'd give him a 4.5 if I could. He handwrites generally legible lecture notes while lecturing and posts those with his lecture recordings which makes reviewing for exams a breeze. His homework is manageable but occasionally he assigns overly complicated textbook problems that don't resemble anything he lectured on or will put on the exam, though the easier homework problems do tend to end up on the exams. Exam content and grading are fair, and I never talked to him but he seems like a nice guy.",3
Awful. Do yourself a favor and do not take his class if you haven't taken a similar class in high school. I had never taken a calculus course and was so lost. Thankfully the TA helped a lot. Never cried over a class as much as this one.,0
"Extremely mid lecturer, has a lot of patience with students who keep answering wrong though. He also pauses in between sentences kind of strangely which is off putting. His quizzes are weekly which forces you to study, and they always have some kind of trick to them. His examples in class don't really help, so this is a self study type of course.",2
"Very nice person, lectures can get a bit boring as they are mostly him writing out textbook definitions. Explanations are convoluted and it took me some time to get to the root of most concepts, but the content itself isn't too difficult. Exams, hw, and projects are all fair.",3
"Very very boring lectures. He goes to quick, and also uses a lot of math slang when writing that is completely unnecessary, and makes it hard to understand. I ended up not going to class after the first midterm, because it is unnecessary. Just study the exam review a day before the test, and you should be good. Worst comes to worst, hire a tutor to go through the review with you if you need help.",1
He's a decent lecturer but a lot of the time he gets way too wordy for a math class instead of going into examples that will help us better understand the topic. GO TO THE DISCUSSIONS the TAs are very good at teaching the topics and you get a quiz at the end of each discussion. Overall if you have a calc background you'll be able to nail this class with an A but even if you don't I feel as the content is easy to pick up.,2
"Awesome, awesome professor. Weekly quizzes are fair and good practice. Homeworks are relevant for the most part, and on average difficult but not impossible. Exams are also incredibly fair, and there is a practice exam posted and a review session in the class before the exam. Dr. Danul is also a great lecturer. He talks slowly, explains topics well, and constantly pauses to make sure everyone is following along. He answers questions well, and my favorite thing he does is relate material to real-world applications. I would 100% recommend taking this course with Dr. Danul, and I wish I had taken more courses with him in the past.",4
"Decent lecturer, but talks basically from textbook examples, and sometimes gives confusing explanations of topics that I later got explained to me much better. Homeworks, R Projects, and Exams are extremely fair, and he never gives you any question even slightly different from something that he puts in the study guide. And he curved final grades!",4
Very good professor and goes into detail very thoroughly. Go to discussions and there are weekly quizzes where some are very challenging. 65% of midterm study guide will be similar to exam. I didn't have calc background so I struggled with this class,2
"Super nice teacher, theres no quizzes in this class which is really nice and removed a lot of stress that would've been there for me, exams were pretty simple and exactly like the practice midterm/final so if you knew how to do every problem on that you're gonna do well on the exam",4
"I had previously taken STAT410 with him and really enjoyed the class, and I wasn’t disappointed this time either. His lectures aren’t recorded, but the in person classes are very valuable to go to, and he takes his time to answer questions so everyone is on the same page. Homeworks are typically given weekly and contain problems that were hard, yet really fun to work through. Quizzes are every Thursday and usually consist of a basic example that he likely already touched upon in the prior lecture. Exams are fair, and some curve will likely be applied at the end fo the class. I would highly recommend any class taught by him.",4
"I was really worried about taking calc because I barely passed pre-cal in high school, but he made it so much easier to understand. I ended up getting a 100 on all of the exams because his lectures and study guides are so useful. He explains all the concepts really well and writes them down while he lectures, so he goes at a pace that's easy to follow. He also records and posts all the lectures in case you miss any or don't want to go. The homework is sometimes confusing but you get 5 attempts to get the right answer and it lines up with the textbook. He seems intimidating at first because he says that you can't make up quizzes that you miss without a university excused absence, but he's really understanding as long as you speak to him beforehand. I highly recommend him!",4
"Danul is a great professor who wants to see each one of his students succeed. Lectures can be a bit disorganized and drawn out at times as he spends time setting up a problem and gives more theory than needed. He does give examples regarding the problem a couple more would be helpful. Positive note, he does record and post what he does in class ! 

Note this class is not much like AP STATS, so if you are new to probability and the statistical world spend some time on the problems. This course is not as easy as many make it out to be, but is not hard if you do his homework problems inside and out as well as other practice from the textbook, which 99% of people neglect. 

His exams are mostly like the homework problems and study guide he gives you which changed up numbers, so make sure to do that as well. One complaint I have is the percentage of the final being 30% standard across the math department. One teacher had the final worth 15%. Homeworks are fairly easy and you can work on them with friends so make sure to take advantage of that opportunity. One downside is that they are graded 1/2 for completion and 1/2 for accuracy with only 3-4 problems being graded in this manner. He doesn't post answer keys so if you got something wrong you could never know but still get a 100 on the homework. He does give decent partial credit with exams. 

If there were 3 exams each worth 15% and the final being worth the same I think it would make the class easier and put less stress on the students grade.",3
"Excellent lecturer - explains concepts well, records every lecture, and posts notes. Exams are a mirror of what's on the homework and study guide. I only had to look over my previous homework and scan through the study guide solutions to do well on the exams. Additionally, Dr. Danul was very understanding, reasonable, and just a nice person in general. I was given extensions when appropriate.

Honestly, unless there is a scheduling conflict, you should take STAT400 with Dr. Danul.",4
"Danul is without a doubt one of the better math teachers I've had. Quizzes every week are annoying, but if you can get Noorain as your TA because he is excellent with quiz prep. Exams are often similar to the practice exams, but ~ one problem each exam is something you haven't really seen before and requires critical thinking. Overall I'd say Danul is one of the better options for Calc 1.",3
Amazing professor who has really fair midterms and he also provides good review materials and practice for the final exam.  He also records lectures so although its helpful you do not have to attend. Discussions are also easy and although theres a quiz its very simple as TAs go over the concepts beforehand and you will get a good score as long as you stay up to date with the previous weeks topics. He also provided a decent curve at the end which helped a lot. Overall the class averages on the exams were really good and as long as you put in the work doing well in this class is very doable.,4
Having prior knowledge in calculus helps a lot in this class. i never attended lecture since it was recorded and posted online. The TA's are very helpful in discussion if you have any questions. The lectures are extremely boring and the study guides didn't help a ton so I would recommend just doing practice problems from the homeworks since they represented the exams a lot more. First exam I got a B+ and the other exams I got an A/A+ on both using this method. However the average was a B- for every exam so I assume he doesn't do the best job at preparing students for the exams.,3
"I enjoyed these lectures a lot tbh. The professor speaks slowly enough that you have time to write everything down, and explains well with examples. He also posts notes and recordings in case you miss class or need to go back. I also just found the material interesting!

Homeworks can be kind of difficult, but are doable. Same for R projects. For both, go to office hours, discussion, and chat with friends in the class. (And my personal advice is to start the final HW and R project earlier - they are a LOT harder than previous ones!) 
The exams are not difficult if you are able to do the homework. Two of the three TAs were not good, but hopefully he will choose better in the future. 

Main criticism: assignments cannot be submitted past the due date unless you email the professor and ask. There’s no % off per day late policy like most teachers have. So, do your assignments on time!! People like me who start it the day it’s due will have some stress and trouble. But always email him if you need an extension because he will probably be nice about it.",4
"knowledgeable, fairly patient during office hours, exact with proofs and math so explanations can be technical and feel overcomplicated, exams similar to homework",3
"Decent professor. Lectures are recorded so you dont have to go to them, his lectures are similar to an audiobook of a textbook to be honest. His exams are very similar to the homework and study guide, so just memorize the questions from those and you will be perfectly fine on the exams. I haven't gone to class for two months and still ended with an A-. Additionally, by memorizing those, you can do well on the final. Imo, the discussions werent that helpful but also I did not go to them because I did not find them useful. Overall decent professor and really nice and always willing to help, just pay attention and do the homework and you will pass with flying colors.",3
"I thought he was a good professor, sometimes he got wordy but overall he ensured students understood what he was explaining and when we ask questions he will clarify or explain further. The material was easy to understand but make sure you go to the discussions. The TAs explain the material we learned that week and there’s a quiz at the end but they were always very helpful.",4
Very kind and knowledgeable. Actually wants the students to succeed. The exams had no curve balls and if you studied the exam review and homework then you will do well. prior to this class i have never taken a stat class either.,3
"Would give 4.5 if I could
Pros:
I honestly liked his lectures, they were easy to follow
I thought material was super interesting and explained stats and probability from ground up
straightforward exams, pretty much carbon copy of practice exams

Cons:
TAs kinda suck
R projects you pretty much had to learn and do by yourself but they weren't bad
Homeworks were sometimes MAD difficult for no reason and there was no answer key (but exams were way easier)
App there was more material than other stat teachers

Overall super solid professor, I learned a lot and class was not difficult by any means",3
"Pros:
- Exams are very very close to the study guides/homeworks. No curveballs whatsoever.
- Pauses a lot during lecture to answer questions.
- Discussion is just TA’s going over homeworks and handing out homework answers. 8 homeworks per semester, 6 questions each (except the first one, which is 5 questions)
- Responds to emails promptly.

Cons:
- He often makes explanations wordy.
- Some parts of statistics require intuition (counting problems).
- Stats is very different from the math you are used to (calculus etc.) and will take some getting used to. Overall, I found this class more difficult than AP Calc BC.
- R projects are difficult and time consuming.",3
"Fall '24: His lectures are frankly very boring but I can't really fault him for anything else. At the end of the day, the material was very digestible and the work was quite easy, particularly the exams which were a breeze. He also just seems like a nice guy and the course is set up well in the sense that he responds quickly to emails, records lectures, and uploads notes. You could do a lot worse.",3
"I feel bad giving Mestiyage a low rating, as he really is a nice guy. Unfortunately the guy just cannot teach, and neither can his TAs. I learned most of the material from external resources as most websites are far better at explaining concepts intuitively than Mestiyage is. 

Additionally, the days of his exams being ripped straight from his practice materials appear to be over. That was not the case this semester.",1
"Nice guy, very understanding, but genuinely one of the most boring professors I've had. Drew out points that could've been made in 2 minutes over entire lectures. I've never been someone who usually skips classes but he really tested my will to attend, I think these reviews definitely make him seem better than he is because he's nice but this class has not been a good experience, though the workload has been very easy.",2
"Professor Danul is a great instructor. He explains concepts clearly and provides helpful examples during lectures. The exams are fair, and if you keep up with the homework and review the study guides, you should do well. I typically just re did the study guide the day before the exam and did fine (3 b+) One thing to keep in mind is that your experience can depend a lot on your Ta, some are more helpful than others, and unfortunately, mine struggled to explain the material clearly. That said, Professor Danul records all of his lectures, which is incredibly helpful. Since he speaks slowly and methodically, I often rewatch them at 2x speed, which works perfectly for reviewing the material.",4
"For all of the MATH120 professors, he's the best from what I've heard. The course is divided up pretty nicely and isn't too rushed. He does explain things in technical terms at some points and that can make it hard to follow along, but the material itself is not hard if you put in work outside of class. He responds quickly to emails, uploads notes and study guides that are pretty similar to the exams and he seems like a nice guy. The weekly quizzes are also not that hard and follow the material done in class. However, the TAs at least in my class were literally no help at all, I'm not sure they understood the questions students were asking half the time, I only showed up to discussion to do the quizzes because the ""help"" from the TAs was little to none.",3
"Nice guy, but one of the most boring teachers I've ever had. If you know the content you'll do well but if you have to learn it from him you'll probably be teaching it to yourself after a month in. I don't recommend him but he's not the worst.",2
Id say take him. He is a super nice professor. Yes he over explains a lot and makes things very wordy but his exams and homeworks are literally so easy if u do the study guide. Sometimes you have to teach yourself because he overcomplicates things a lot but usually the lectures are easy to follow. I was always so bad at math but this class never stressed me out. Take him you wont regret it.,3
"Danul is a great guy and is very understanding. He can be a bit wordy at times but I know he means well. I almost failed pre-calc last semester so I was a bit worried coming into calc in the spring. However, as long as you do the study guides and re-watch lectures you'll be fine. The only thing I would complain about is that the textbook and the homework assignments would have content we wouldn't spend that much time on, so they didn't really become a resource to me for exams.",3
"It took a few lectures for me to get used to his teaching style, but once I did the class was super easy. The study guides prepare you for the exams really well and the exams are fairly easy if you do study. The homework isn't an overwhelming amount, but the questions are usually a lot harder than what you would see on the exams. He uses MingPress which isn't a great platform as if you get a problem wrong it doesn't tell you the correct answer. The quizzes are also reasonable and if you study you'll do good. Overall I really recommend Danul for this course.",4
"I honestly really liked Danul and I found that despite overexplaining problems and confusing some students, he's a great professor. You definitely need to come in with some knowledge on basic algebra, but it's fine because the quizzes during discussions always makes sure you to stay up to date with your basic math skills. If you study and learn how to answer all the questions on the study guides(literally learn how to do them because similar problems show up on exams), you will do so well in this class. It isn't difficult and all resources are handed to you in order to excel.",4
"Professor Danul is a pretty good professor. Lectures were sometimes slow and a little iffy, but he was very helpful still. All lectures were recorded which was helpful.  Discussion was not helpful to me and it would honestly just confuse me more. This class wasn't that bad, my only complaints were the study guides never covered everything that would be on the exam. Also, we didn't finish the last topic for the final until like a class or two before it (we also had a quiz in discussion the week before which I found annoying). Other than that, he's a great prof. I didn't come into this class with any calculus experience and being extremely horrible at math, and still somehow clutched a b so I recommend!",3
"Good professor—sometimes gets a bit wordy when explaining things, but overall he's clear and thorough. The exams are pretty similar to the study guides, which is helpful. One tip: while the study guide problems often result in whole number answers, a decent number of exam questions ended in fractions. Make sure you're comfortable working with those—especially when dealing with derivatives and similar topics, as it can get a little confusing even if you're confident in calculus.

Two of the lowest quiz grades are dropped, and the homework is fair. Lectures are recorded, so I rarely went to class, but I always attended discussion because of the quizzes.

He does a great job preparing you for the exams and genuinely wants his students to succeed.",4
"Very great and understand professors. Gives you an hour after due dates to still turn in for full credit. Study guides are very helpful for the exam, and homework's and.R projects are all fair.",4
He is truly amazing and makes calc easy to learn. He is old fashion in the sense he uses pen and paper to do everything but it works for him. I never got less than an A on a midterm and he makes you very prepared for any midterm/final.,4
"As a stats newbie, I loved STAT401 with Danul! His class is super organized, covering hypothesis tests, ANOVA, linear regression, and more at a perfect pace. Danul's notes are crystal clear, and he's a chill grader who gives homework extensions and cares about your success. Some tricky concepts could use clearer explanations, but stats is tough, so I get it. If you're at UMD, take his class! Pro tip: bring snacks to office hours. Danul's a snack king and he will be extremely grateful. Highly recommend!",3
"Overall, I would say that he is a pretty good professor. Only thing I didn’t like was that he would sometimes over explain things that would end up taking 5 mins. Then this would lead him to rushing towards the end of the class, making things more confusing. Other than that, he answers all the students questions. His study guides for midterms are also very similar to what is actually on the exam (besides 1 question sometimes). There are also weekly quizzes in discussion (besides exam weeks). One thing about the TA though is that he would sometimes jump a few steps in calculating things which would then confuse some students. Other than that, I liked both the professor and TA.",3
Overall a fine professor. Has a bit of an accent but easy enough to understand. He definitely over explains things and over complicates simple topics. You will take a ton of notes in his class and he re-writes every problem even the wordy ones this causes him to have to rush toward the end of lecture. All his lectures are recorded which is nice. Gave good practice for midterm exams but did not give any practice material for the final besides old finals. (The questions change every year so it’s not a great representation). Responds to emails quickly. He is a fine professor having a high-school background in calculus will definitely be helpful as this is a pretty fast paced course.,2
Professor is great but seriously I never came to know what he expects in his subject. he would ask simple question but while checking he needs a lot of things and its very unintuitive.,0
"Great professor, explains content well overall. Sometimes he rushes through examples but he's very receptive when you ask him to explain something again. Exams are super fair and homework is gone over in weekly discussions before due. Class can sometimes be a bit of a snoozefest but Danul is by far the best option for STAT400 and I would highly recommend him.",4
"Assignments are almost free 100's, so it's down to the exams, which aren't too bad if you know your calculus (and can be bothered to study). He provides an extremely generous study guide with answers, and makes both his lecture recordings and writings accessible. No quizzes too, which is really nice.

As generous as the assignments are I felt like Danul explained concepts in lecture in extremely roundabout and confusing ways, and I personally found it better to learn from the TA or the textbook as a primary source, but also useful to peek at the lecture notes and such secondarily.",3
"A goated professor who cares about students success and is very helpful. He is very lenient with grading and has fair exams but be sure to study as things could get tricky. 

PROS:
1) Good grading
2) Nice professor
3) Small class

CONS:
1) Not recored lecture
2) Somewhat theoretical at some points

I call him MDDKG and he is one mountain goat",4
"In case you're wondering, Danul and Mestiyage are two of the names for the same guy. 

Nothing brilliant, nothing flawed about STAT400 with Gunatilleka. He has a system figured out, and it worked for me. Safest/least risky choice. 

- 30% final, 2x15% midterm, 3x4% R Project, 28% (~8) homework. 
- Homeworks discussed in Discussion, people actually go surprisingly
- R projects mildly annoying, but like the homeworks, a grade booster
- Exams had slightly lower than typical averages, but nothing crazy. There were four versions of each exam, so it was pretty formulaic without curveballs. 
- Lectures recorded, handwritten notes, ~20% attendance. Many places to learn the content. He's a fine teacher, speaks clearly, etc, so I went, and that was enough. Just don't think too deeply at times. That could cost you your sanity. We don't spend much time on derivations, so turn your brain off and apply the formulas.",3
super nice guy and curves the class at the end of the semester but i would have done terribly if i didn’t have a solid background in calc from high school. i felt like he made concepts much more complex than they had to be. a friend of mine in the class with me never took calc and definitely struggled because of his teaching,2
"If you're taking math 120 and don't have the chance to take Gruber, then take Gunatilleka. He's a very nice professor who knows what he's teaching and teaches it well. We had weekly quizzes in discussion which were only made up of 2 questions. One being a basic algebra question ( that's why you need a good foundation in algebra) and the other was on the material we were learning. He posts all of his lecture videos and puts out a study guide before each exam (4 total exams). When it comes to making up work he's very lenient and will let you make the work if you have reason. the only downside is that the study guides don't always cover all the material for the exams so you have to deal with that.",4
"TL;DR: Lectures can feel a bit slow or boring at times, but he genuinley cares about his students and is good and explaining things slowly

Pros:
 - Exams were very very similar to practice exams
 - Homeworks were a little tough, but doable
 - quizzes were either once a week or once every two weeks depending on how he was feeling. Usually similar to an example in class though, so they weren't bad if you showed up to class.
 - Genuinely great at explaining things starting from the basics and working up
 - Works almost 1:1 from the textbook, so even if you miss class, you can read the textbook to catch up.

Cons: 
 - Lectures can be kinda boring as he is a little monotone and lecutres can move slow a lot of the time.",4
The absolute goat. Explains material so well. Records all lectures. Exams are super fair. Homeworks are long but still fair. Take STAT401 with no one else but the legend Danul.,4
